This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've led a significant project at Harver, transitioning from a monolithic system to an event-driven architecture. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced during this transition and how you addressed them with the technologies you mentioned?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: So some challenges were maintaining, uh, consistent behavior across uh, this transition period from the legacy software to the new software. Uh, this was done through identifying what is, like, the list of APIs we have, their current set of behavior, uh, what is the expected behavior of all those APIs. This way as we as I led the transition, uh, from the legacy software to the event driven sort of more, uh, new serverless architecture. We maintain consistent behavior and thus induce the element of least surprise, which in this case would be to not suddenly change the behavior of any of these APIs, uh, throughout this transition period. And this was done using AWS Lambdas, s q AWS SQS. Uh, this is all on Python. And some of the, uh, legacy, uh, tools and technologies that were made use of consists of as Celery and, uh, RabbitMQ.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a thoughtful approach to maintaining consistency during such a critical transition. Could you detail how you ensured the reliability and scalability of the new event-driven system, particularly in terms of managing the interactions between different services, and what role did Redis play in this architecture?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: This was through so the ecosystem behavior was maintained through rigorous test coverage. And so, uh, use it's made the use of tools like SonarQube and Codecov to measure the test coverage of our application code both before and throughout this development process, maintaining a high test coverage of, say, 98% and above. This helped to ensure that if any changes made, broke behavior, uh, those will be caught by tests and to help cover interactions across services because, uh, our services were made comprised of many different link services. And so interactions between and across services was very important to cover, and this was covered through the usage of integration tests, uh, something I introduced when I introduced the CICD pipeline using tools like Go CD. Uh, this helped to automate this whole process of testing our services and these various transactions, uh, in an automatic fashion and thus automatically be able to catch if any of these, uh, behaviors were broken or changed. And as for the usage, of Redis, Redis was used as a caching, uh, solution, uh, for one of the services that, uh, was being upgraded.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your emphasis on rigorous testing and the use of tools like SonarQube and GoCD for automation is impressive. Given your experience with maintaining high test coverage, how do you approach testing asynchronous processes, such as those handled by Celery in your Python applications?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So you go about testing the individual application code that gets executed, uh, asynchronously. This helps to ensure that that piece of code is what's working. And then as for testing, okay, the actual application code that calls this asynchronously, uh, that is mocked in unit test coverage. And so there's coverage up to the point it gets executed, and then there's validation done to ensure that what's being asynchronously handed off is what's expected to be handed off. But then as for, like, testing the actual execution of the asynchronous code, that's where sort of these integration tests or these more, uh, expensive tests come into play. Uh, and that's where, like, the benefits of having a CICD pipeline to, uh, be able to introduce these kinds of tests, uh, becomes more valuable. So that way we can more thoroughly test our systems and thoroughly test not just, uh, transactions across services, but these asynchronous transactions as well and validate that they're behaving as expected.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you have a strong grasp on testing methodologies for both synchronous and asynchronous processes. Shifting focus a bit, could you explain how you approached the integration with Oracle and Workday, particularly in terms of handling data consistency and reliability across these disparate systems within your event-driven architecture?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So it starts off with first working with external stakeholders, working with them on what are their APIs, what is their API contracts, working with clients, uh, understanding the client's needs, their expectations, what are the different user stories, uh, ironing out what are the different user stories and, uh, expected user experiences with the product. And then once we have all those pieces together, then we can go ahead and start building out and designing a system that integrates with these various systems, like Workday and Oracle, and supports these different, uh, user stories. And as for, like, data consistency and data reliability, uh, that's where, uh, making use of tools like, uh, so in this case, the servers that handle these integrations with these systems like Workday and Oracle. I made use of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and our automatic retry policies played a big part in helping to ensure that if errors were occurring or something was just down temporarily, retries would automatically occur to help ensure those transactions continued. But then if those transactions failed altogether, uh, what I had in place was some rigorous logging and telemetry instrumentation setup via New Relic. And this helped to be able to quickly identify issues in the system and thus resolve them. And then on a per system or per client basis, uh, for if errors had occurred with the, uh, resolution strategy or contingency plan or fallback, uh, for those clients. Uh, depends on each of those clients and their needs. Uh, in some cases, we had mechanisms in place, uh, that not even engineering need to get involved with. But, uh, our client success team can they themselves, uh, empower them to be able to take into their own hands, to be able to initiate these processes to, uh, essentially\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to handling integrations and ensuring fault tolerance is comprehensive. Regarding the use of New Relic for monitoring and alerting, could you discuss how you configured New Relic to provide meaningful insights into your system's performance, particularly in identifying potential bottlenecks or issues with the distributed transactions across your microservices architecture?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So it's making heavily heavily made use of AWS Lambdas for which there's New Relic plugins and that can be used to funnel essentially all your logs from your CloudWatch log groups to New Relic. And in doing that, I'm able to make use of New Relic's monitoring and alerting to set up alerts and monitors on our various Lambdas, uh, for when the error shall, say, exceed a certain limit, send off, say, a PagerDuty alert in some cases if it's been such a prolonged error. And with the use of New Relic, I'm able to analyze sort of the error rate, the stack traces, and the logs with these associated with these transactions to be able to thoroughly, uh, dig deep into these errors and to be able to dig deep into, uh, what the root cause may be.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your use of New Relic for AWS Lambda monitoring is insightful. Given the distributed nature of serverless applications, how do you manage and monitor the performance of your AWS Lambda functions to ensure optimal resource utilization and minimize cold start times, especially in high-traffic scenarios?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So made use of AWS layers to sort of offset or separate out some of the larger packages that is used in the application. Uh, this helped to minimize the deployment times and cold start times for our Lambdas since there's less in the Lambda now, uh, for to having to boot up with with cold start times. I've also made use of migrating our Lambdas over to US East to Ohio, which at the time, uh, Amazon themselves was pushing out updates, uh, to improve the performance of Lambdas, especially cold start times and their performance in the VPC. So it took advantage of Amazon's latest updates to Lambdas, uh, with regards to cold start times. Uh, additionally, with the usage of new reli comm, able to get, uh, deeper insights into the breakdown of what the lambdas are spending time on. So what this breakdown consists of is time spent on, say, on API transactions, web transactions, uh, with, say, s 3 with the DynamoDB and sort of able to more easily uh, identify what are the bottlenecks currently, uh, in our application, uh, what does the Lambda spend the most time on currently, and go from there, uh, if there's an issue with the response times or with throughput in the current state of the lambda.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your strategies for optimizing AWS Lambda functions are quite innovative. Considering the use of AWS Layers, could you elaborate on how you identify which dependencies to include in the layer to effectively reduce the size of the deployment package and further minimize cold start times?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So since these are microservices, uh, they're small. And so the amount of packages they have in them is also small, and so it's easy to sift through these list of packages and identify, okay, what are the largest packages we're using. So in this case, our largest packages were diffuse XML and, uh, Boto 3, both of which are very large packages, uh, Python packages. And so it made sense to rather than having to repackage and deploy these, uh, libraries every time we wanna deploy our microservice, It would make more sense, uh, to deploy them separately as a layer, uh, especially as I looked at their version history and found that they're not very often updated as well, these packages. And so if there's ever comes a need to update these packages, uh, we can update them uh, on a need as needed, uh, for when we actually do get updated, uh, by updating the specific layer.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to identifying and separating out large dependencies into AWS Layers is quite strategic. Shifting focus to a different aspect of your technical skills, could you discuss a scenario where you had to optimize a Django ORM query for better performance, and the specific techniques or tools you used to achieve this?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So I've had to optimize, uh, various things with regards to Jeng ORM, uh, queries, migrations, uh, and such. And so some of the techniques I've made use of is to uh, use the Django's commands for domingo. What is the raw SQL? Uh, because in our case, the back end storage being used was a MySQL, uh, AWS Aurora database. And so Django has the ability in its ORM to dump out for you, uh, with its, uh, uh, the ORM query, what is the behind the scenes SQL that it's making use of. And so in some cases, I would take a look at that to see, okay, how is Django executing this query, uh, going through the Django documentation as well to see, like, what are some of the fine nuances. Uh, with, say, like, select, uh, related, prefesh, select, uh, related, uh, so those query optimizations there. And then with regards to migrations, uh, taking a look at, okay, what is the type of migration being performed? Is it an update in alteration to a currently existing column? Are we adding new columns? How big is the table, uh, we're modifying? Are we introducing a new table? What form keys are being added and such? And so looking at the whole culmination of data there, uh, then determining, okay, what is the best strategy to go forward with with this migration? Should it be done piecewise? Should part of it be done as a Jenga migration and a part of it be done asynchronously over time as sort of like a backfilling task. And so those are, like, some various strategies and things to consider, uh, when optimizing, like, a JANORM query or migration.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to optimizing Django ORM queries, especially the use of raw SQL via Django's capabilities, is quite insightful. Could you delve into the considerations for choosing between synchronous and asynchronous operations in the context of a Django application, particularly when it comes to handling high-concurrency scenarios or long-running tasks?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: So this depends on say your use case of like okay for looking to horizontally scale. Concurrently handle a lot of transactions at once this depends on the type of transactions, too. so if say your application is a very read heavy service. And so you're having to concurrently handle a lot of Rights. Jiang you can do that with Django concur me write to your database. but it depends on like What those rights are you riding you items every time. Are you making older Asians to an existing row multiple times over which case you need to take into consideration item potency to ensure consistency in your data? and then Also, what is like you just stories usually expectations with data availability? Should isolated and see between what the users seeing and the most up-to-date data. ah something that's okay to be expected or is that not okay in which case asynchronous? transactions may not be as okay may need to Make your things more synchronous this would also. potentially correlate with what sort of bag and data story using too This is my SQL relational databases lend itself more for these asset Trends actions. with synchronous transactions and helping to ensure that Thomas City the isolation consistency in the durability of your data whereas if you're looking to you can currently handle and scale and are fine with sort of that description seen dad and late in C between what a user sees and the most up to date Dada then no sequel databases. It's probably will you'll be using to handle that sort of horizontally scaling workload.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your detailed explanation on the considerations for synchronous versus asynchronous operations in Django, especially in the context of data consistency and the type of database being used, is quite insightful. Could you discuss how you have implemented custom middleware in Django to solve a specific problem, and the impact it had on the overall system performance or behavior?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I haven't specifically worked on, uh, middleware with Django, but I have made, uh, alterations to middleware, uh, legacy middleware that was made using Django, which I've noticed that\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given your experience with modifying existing Django middleware, could you elaborate on the types of alterations you made to the Legacy middleware, focusing on the specific goals you aimed to achieve with these changes and any observations regarding the impact on system behavior or performance?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: This is more so in regards to upgrading the service from Python to the Python 3, which involved making upgrades to the version of Django and Django rest framework or DRF, uh, that's being made use of. And some of the syntax involved in this middleware, uh, some of the, uh, APIs used there were deprecated. And so I was making upgrades to not to remove, replace it, or upgrade it, but rather to just maintain consistency and make it compatible, uh, with the upgrade that was being done at the time.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

I see from your resume that you've led the transformation of legacy systems into microservices at your current role. Can you walk me through the biggest challenge you faced during this transformation and how you overcame it?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Definitely. Yeah. So I have joined in Contentstack as a senior software engineer. And, uh, so we already have an application which is running in the production from long back, uh, but that is a legacy application. It is a single code base. The code base is very huge. It contains, uh, more than 10,000, uh, commits and the repo size also very big. So what we planned, uh, is, like, to convert application into microservices. Give you an example, like, uh, the I have worked on, um, uh, 4, 5 components, which I converted to microservices. I I'll give you an example where, uh, we have converted that into microservices architecture. Uh, we have a functionality called Webex. So Webex is a functionality where if, uh, we will trigger the events to the customer's endpoints. So, basically, the Webex application is create is a very big functionality in our content stack, uh, where we need to trigger the events to customers. Since, like, we have a Alexa application, like, uh, if there is any issue in, uh, any of the component, we need to redeploy complete code base, and it's very difficult to maintain. So we had to convert that to microservice. So we created a new microservices application. Uh, so the application we have built it, uh, Node JS. Uh, we use it in SDS framework to build a microservice. Uh, Alan said we also have our sidecar, which will be used to authenticate and authorize the requests to the core CMA database. And, uh, we have done the, like, we book microservice up, uh, like, that is we in the Weebook microservices, there are 2 parts. 1 is the Weebook management, and the another part is the job processing, uh, daily jobs. How the the the background jobs? Like, to say, like, let's say there are a 1,000 webhooks are like in in general, like, daily, we will need to process, uh, webhooks in 1,000,000. So at the time, we cannot process all the webhooks. So we will, uh, use the SQS queues to process all these events. So for each event, we'll store in the queue, and the the microservices will pull that message, and then it will process it 1 by 1. Also, we have used the Kubernetes to, uh, auto scale the ports whenever, uh, there is a lot of messages in the queue. That's a\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive overview, thank you. Given the complexity of managing distributed systems like the one you've described, how do you approach monitoring and logging in your microservices architecture to ensure everything runs smoothly?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Correct. So, uh, in the distributed system, logging is very important, and, uh, we are log we are using the data that to log, uh, to track all the logging and the monitoring and, uh, to track the SLOs. And, uh, it needs each microservices which we are building. So we will track the logs at the environment level and the organization level. So we have a clean track keep clean track of the all the web, uh, like, logs which is coming through the application, which goes to the, uh, Datadog. So there is a different kind of log levels, which is like, uh, info log level at error log levels, one log level. So based on the severity of the log, we will, uh, set up the SLOs. Also, we will create the SLAs, SLIs indicators. So based on that, we will set up SLOs. And then we will use the data app to monitor. Given your\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Given your experience with Node.js in building and managing microservices, what are some specific design patterns you've found effective in ensuring the scalability and reliability of your services?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Can you come again? Sorry. Certainly.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Certainly. I'm interested in the design patterns you've found effective for ensuring scalability and reliability in your Node.js microservices. Could you discuss some specific design patterns you've implemented or relied on for this purpose?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: We have used, like, a different, uh, design patterns. So when it comes to the rest API, we will use the, uh, rest standard patterns, uh, like, where we need to give the rest API endpoints to the customers. Uh, there we will use the rest API. Uh, for rest API, we use the next framework, uh, where we have defined the each routes and, uh, which is exposed to the public. When it comes to the, uh, internal, uh, data internal data transfer, like, from 1 micro service to enter micro services, the gRPC is the good option since it is faster than the rest API service. So since, uh, that's why we have used the gRPC for the internal communication where uh, the other restricted methods are excluded through gRPC, which is, uh, easy and, uh, faster communication with the within the local metro services. Also, there is some digital consumers elsewhere, uh, we have used the SQS to pull the messages and to process those messages. Whenever there is available in the messages, automatically, the consumer will pull the message, and it will process, and then it will continue tries to pull the from the queues. So queue patterns, DRP services, REST APIs, these are all different patterns, uh, are like architects as which we have used in the microservices, architects implementation. Fascinating.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Fascinating approach. Considering your use of gRPC for internal communication, how do you handle service discovery and load balancing in a gRPC-based architecture, especially when running on a platform like Kubernetes?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Yeah. So since we are using the, uh, Kubernetes, so we also using the Kubernetes, uh, event driven arc auto scaling, Kedap. Kubernetes event driven auto scaling policy where we will define, uh, scaling policies based on different patterns. Uh, let's say, like, uh, there is a huge traffic on the GRPCs. So since we are using SQS, based on the queue length, uh, we will, uh, automatically detect the queue length. If there is a lot of messages, automatically, we will set, like so if for this many, uh, like, let's say that for every page, 30 messages, we need to create a new pod. So, automatically, it will takes care about the auto scaling, and it will, uh, make choose the auto scaling efficiently, and it will make sure the process is smooth without breaking the system at once. Like, even when That's a\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a solid strategy for leveraging Kubernetes' autoscaling capabilities. Shifting focus a bit, could you discuss a scenario where you had to optimize a Node.js application for performance, particularly in the context of handling a high volume of concurrent requests?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Yeah. Let's take the previous example which I told you, like, uh, Webhooks, microservices. There we have faced this issue where we are processing the events at 1 one event at a time. Uh, so how it is working is, like, each part level, one event will be processed once. So what happens is, like, if, let's say, one request is we will trigger a webhook to the customer's, uh, HTTP URL. And if the customer is taking longer times, automatically, it will completely affecting the performance of the application. Like, uh, if the each request is taking 20, 15 seconds, then it is a huge effect on the service. So what we thought is, like, we have implemented a feature, uh, in the Facebook microservices where we will concurrently process certain number of messages. In our case, it is 20. So each time it will tries to process 20 messages, we we will make, uh, we will, uh, handle a queue where, uh, each time there is, uh, 20 messages are there. Whenever one message is completed, automatically, new message will be sent to the queue. That is one approach which we have used, uh, to automatically, uh, to scale the concurrent request instead of blocking the complete, uh, queue seems like, uh, the node supports the even driven non blocking mechanism. This is very helpful here. Yes. I\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: I appreciate the detailed example of how you leveraged concurrency to improve performance. In a similar vein, considering the use of Redis in your stack, could you explain how you've utilized Redis to solve specific problems in your applications, particularly in the context of ensuring data consistency and high availability?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yep. I can give you certain examples how we have leverage in the release. Let's, uh, we have also implemented a new feature in the web book microservices where, let's say, uh, a customer is taking the longer times to respond. Uh, so how it is? Like, it so if one customer is taking longer times to respond automatically since we are using a single queue, uh, so it is completely affecting for other customer is occupying the parts completely. They are taking longer time. So we are, uh, leveraging the release to track the active request in the release. Uh, so let's say whenever new request track, uh, like, we will increment the active count 1, and when the request is processed, we will decrement that. So in the similar way, so there is always, like, there is certain number of misses only we will process to a one customer so that it will make sure, uh, the other parts are available for other customers every time. So let's say we have a maximum of, uh, 100 parts. So we will only, uh, allocate the 10 ports to the customers by taking the app to, uh, process in the release. That is one use case. Also, we use it in a different use case. If the customer is taking longer time. So so we will track the customer's response, the average time in the last 15 minutes. If the response time is more than the 15 minutes, then automatically, we will block those message processing from the main queue, and, uh, we will push those message to the different queue so that, uh, there is no blocking from these customers to the other messages. This blocking like, since one customer is causing issue, this one customer's message will be processed in that different queue. And, uh, other that that queue message will be pulled by other different consumer. And, uh, yep. So it will in this way, also, we have user. Your use of\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your use of Redis for managing active requests and handling response times is quite innovative. Given the critical role Redis plays in these scenarios, how do you ensure the reliability and performance of Redis itself, especially in a high-throughput environment?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. So since, uh, our application is a high throughput environment since, like, we will process the millions of books every day. So since, like, the the main data the primary source of the data we are using, the MongoDB, uh, the the data which we are storing in the Redshift, the secondary data. So even in case of for, like, uh, there is some issue with the Redis data, like, let's say, uh, the counts which we are tracking for the active response time is also the, uh, the average response times. If it is inconsistent, then what we will do is we are setting up the TPL. So which will make sure the data is clean up every certain interval so that if if there is any issue occurs like it is within the certain time frame interval so that the inconsistency won't carry forward. Uh, so at the end, like, we are solving the customer's problem at each frequent intervals. But before that, uh, they won't first, we need to make sure that there is no data inconsistency in the release even if it occurs, like, since we are cleaning up the inconsistency with each in like, a TTL with each intervals by using the TTL time to you setup, uh, that is making sure, like, uh, that data consistency in that in our application. Implement\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Implementing TTL for data in Redis is a good strategy for maintaining consistency. Given your experience with setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters for your microservices, what are some best practices you've followed to ensure security within the cluster, especially considering the sensitive nature of the data your applications handle?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. To be frank, like so, uh, I have a detailed knowledge about the Kubernetes. I have a dedicated dev ops teams who will take complete Kubernetes deployments and, uh, all the processes. But when it comes to developer as a developer from my side, so I have, like, just we'll test, like, what strategies we need to use in DevOps. What is the load load auto scaling policies, get a policies which we need to set up? So coming to the security reviews, like, I'm exactly not much sure about that. But, uh, as a developer, I completely focus on push tag development, not much, uh, into the Kubernetes. Kubernetes, the high level overview, I have a how it is helping the customers to, um, like, scale, how to scale and enhance the application functionalities. Let's say, like, I'll give an example. Like, let's say we have an like, if you are using a monolithic application, then we may use this, uh, an AC to instance. But if it comes to Microsoft Research, it is best to use the Kubernetes. So where we can, uh, certainly define the, uh, CPU and the memory limits within the parts so that if we require like, let let's say, one microservices may require only 256 MB and 0.25 milli cores of CPU, then we can set up that particular limits within the board and so that it will allow and it will so that we we're able to utilize the CPU and memory efficiently so that there is no wastage of the memory and CPU by using, uh, like, not this is not in the case of, uh, EC two instances. Here, we can certainly define the limits for each word. It's clear.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you've focused on leveraging Kubernetes for efficient resource utilization. Given your emphasis on helping to define auto-scaling and resource limits, how do you approach container security within the development lifecycle? Are there specific tools or processes you've found effective in ensuring that the containers you deploy are secure?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Yeah. So we are using the Argo CD, like, uh, which is connected, uh, so, uh, which is directly connected to the Kubernetes instances. So which will make sure the build and the deploy process. So whenever the developer commits something to the gate, so the gate will be, uh, triggers a message to the cargo CD where the code is build and code will be checked linked and build. Once that is done, it will create a building is so the image will be pulled by the Kubernetes ports, and it will create the new process. So, uh, that's complete security of the port will be taken care within the Argo CD and the Kubernetes environment. Leverage\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging Argo CD for continuous deployment is indeed a strong security practice. In addition to Argo CD, are there any specific security scanning tools or methodologies you've integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the images being deployed are free from vulnerabilities?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: This, like, uh, integration, which will continuously takes the vulnerability packages if there is any discrepancy in the packages. The Nike is a good tool to check the code and the packages. Using\\n'], ['Interviewer: Using Snyk for continuous vulnerability monitoring is a solid approach. How do you ensure that the dependencies you use in your Node.js applications, especially those for critical functionalities, are kept up to date with the latest security patches and best practices?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Since we are using the snake, uh, snake will automatically suggest the latest security patches, which we will, uh, like, strictly follow the snake upgrades, which is which is suggesting by the snake. So whenever there is upgrade, uh, it will automatically create the PR with the patches which we need to do. Uh, so we will take a review of that PR, and, uh, we will automatically take consideration of that package upgrade. So and then we will thoroughly test complete functionality of the application once we have touched the package upgrade. Relying\\n'], ['Interviewer: Relying on Snyk for automated dependency updates and then conducting thorough testing is a strong strategy for keeping your applications secure and up to date. How do you handle error and exception logging in your Node.js applications, especially in a distributed microservices environment, to ensure that issues are quickly identified and resolved?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Oh, yes. Since we are using the node.js within nodejs we are using the HDs framework next is framework is providing a very good functionalities for with the different modules even config modules logging modules. We are leveraging the logger module of the inheres which will standardize the complete application logic. Once the logging is done automatically all these lock the kubernetes automatically push this logs to the like there is a agent installed the data log isn't is installed here. So automatically all the messages which is coming into the kubernetes in environment level cluster level will go to the data dog. So we will we have set up a clean. Service level indicators and the service level objectives, which we need to monitor. If there is any issue. We also set up alarms. By using the efficiency, which will make sure the all the everything everything. Every system is completely up and running if there is any issue it will alert, the people who is responsible for the particular feature the response like kadal acting mechanism. We have set up into there is like two steps one is the warning level which is when it to certain percent maybe 340% When is there a level which is when it to 70% of 90% whatever we Define so that when the statements are reached in the warning level the male there is a male setup on the when they are Level comes automatically they call it to the people from the obscene. And also we are using the alarms. also, we are using the data log monitoring These all are helping us to track the logs based on the logs. We are setting up the SLS. SLS which is by using this approach. We are completely able to manage the our services in the distributed systems when it comes to in the node.js applications how we are tracking the errors responses. We are setting up the default Global exception filters which which will track the any kind of exceptions are error handlers, which will then it will process the errors in a standard format and then it will push through the data.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Leveraging the Hapi framework for standardized logging and monitoring through DataDog is a robust approach. Could you delve into how you define and manage Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) in your microservices architecture, particularly in the context of a Node.js application?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes, sure. Definitely. Let's take an example of the rest API application in case of in this case microservice webbook microservices where customers can create or get the logs of the webbook are like there can be updates delays within the way book so that whenever there is something if there is any errors occurred, so we are completely tracking like each request response in the data dog. So whenever you request comes we will keep track of the start log whenever the response is completed. We will keep track of the response in the data with the industry. So for each so as a service level indicator, we will track the on each log level. We will track the status code if the status code is coming within 200 that means it is Success then whenever there is a status code other than 200 that means it is failed status so that we will create an Indicator based on the status code by using the service level indicator. We will create a cell which will keep on an average like in the NS 10s. It will create a slope based on the syndicator and we will make sure that like in one day like how many error course we should in 3 days how many error codes we have set up a list based on that.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Your view? Uh, one second.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Absolutely, let's continue. I see from your resume that you've worked on improving job executions at AMEX's Merchant Data Capabilities project. Can you walk me through the specific technologies and strategies you used to achieve that 70% improvement in job executions?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so be basically, before that, what we were doing is we were using MapReduce, uh, where we were writing the code in may Hadoop MapReduce. So it was it was taking some time. Uh, it was taking time as is it takes, uh, too much time to execute. So for that, uh, we have converted it into Spark migration. So it into so converting the code into Spark, what it does, it it it computes real time processing. So it implements it. Uh, so what what it do, it it deals like a so so it makes the job more faster as, uh, Spark is 10 to 100 times faster than, uh, Huddl.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant improvement. Migrating to Spark for real-time processing is a smart move. Can you elaborate on how you utilized Spark's features to optimize the data processing, and were there any particular challenges you faced during this migration?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what what we used is, uh, like, we we use various features of, uh, Spark. So, basically so what we do is we, uh, first converted all the base jobs into Spark jobs, and we used all the the best practices that needed to be in the, like, for cross joining, broadcast joins. So we maintain all the things. And also, we mentioned where we use some fine tunings as well, and, uh, that's how, uh, we we do. So in first, we got some, uh, maybe there's issues as well, like, uh, the MapReduce job were very hard to understand and in converting it into Spark. It it was much a difficult task. So we we created test like, we created test to suit for that and, uh, executed test, and it made sure, like, uh, our our product our output was as required. So this is how we make sure.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a comprehensive approach to the migration, focusing on best practices and fine-tuning. Testing is crucial in such transitions. Given your experience with Spark, how do you handle data skew or hotspots, and could you describe a scenario where you had to address this issue in your project?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so so there was a issue. Like, uh, when when we were joining, we have one table, uh, that contains billions of records. And there was a, uh, there was a small smaller table. It is joining with a small table, uh, which has, like, uh, maybe thousands of records. So, uh, so when we were doing this in the like, it is it was taking some time, uh, in the background. So what we have used in case of that is we use the broadcast giant. Like, uh, we, like, we we, like, dug it copied all those, uh, small tables into all the workers and, uh, and, like, and joined on the basis of that. So he did made, uh, made the operation more faster than So this is how we handle the the SKU. SKU.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using broadcast joins to distribute the smaller table across all workers is a classic solution to data skew in Spark. It's great to hear that you applied this technique effectively. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you've also worked with GCP. Can you tell me about a project where you leveraged GCP services, and how you integrated them with your existing technologies to solve a particular problem?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so the the yeah. There was a project, uh, which we have, like, created before. It was online in the grocery ordering system. So it was basically a website which contains various microservices. So we, like, deployed it, uh, through Jenkins and Docker. And after that, we have to, like, uh, implement it, like, put it on the cloud. Like, we have to migrate it to on place to cloud. So for that, we use the, uh, GCP for that. So what we do in GCP, uh, is basically we, like, uh, we use just all the compute instances and all the GCP services, which are required, uh, uh, which are required for our application to work there. So we use the compute engine instances. And so, basically, we we, uh, we had gone with the engine for that. So engine is, uh, standard mode, and we deployed our application there. So it did scale automatically, and this is how we intended.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Migrating a microservices architecture to GCP using Jenkins and Docker is a solid approach. You mentioned using Compute Engine instances. Could you elaborate on how you managed the deployment and scaling of your microservices in GCP? Did you use any specific GCP tools or services for load balancing, auto-scaling, or service discovery?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. So what we do, uh, what what what we did, uh, is we used the, uh, app engine service project. So we have created a app engine project in Google and deployed our service there. So it automatically in background, it automatically increases, uh, on the basis of load. So this is how and for load balancing, we used the global, uh, load balancer as provided. So so a a engine auto a engine automatically enters, load balancing as well. So we just deployed our application. It in a it took a lot of operational work from us and ended it.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging App Engine for auto-scaling and the global load balancer for load distribution is a smart choice for a scalable and resilient deployment. It's good to hear that you've had hands-on experience with these GCP services. Given your role in leading the development of the Online Grocery Store project, how did you ensure that your team's code adhered to best practices, and what kind of code reviews or quality checks did you implement to maintain high standards?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so so for the best practices, what we end up, like, we followed all the procedures. And, uh, from the documentation itself, we used, uh, like, we used what the procedures to be followed in code while writing code. And, also, we made sure to write test cases and cover whole classes, uh, in the test cases, in whole scenarios. And, also, after that, uh, we for for for after testing, we we have some senior senior members that took they they take the they took the code reviews for that. And the and if if they found problem, uh, it goes back to the developer, and the developer solve the that. And maybe go it goes back to texting, and then, uh, for the second code review, and it goes through this. So this is, uh, how the flow of the code review works here.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a thorough process, ensuring code quality through documentation, comprehensive test coverage, and peer reviews. It's great to see that you've incorporated these practices into your workflow. Speaking of test coverage, can you discuss how you approach writing unit tests for your Java applications, and perhaps share your experience with any particular testing frameworks or strategies you've found effective?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so for that, what what we do, uh, what we did here, uh, is, like, for every, uh, like, uh, for every services that we have created. So so for each classes, what we did is we created, uh, each test cases and write the test cases in j unit. So we used the, uh, j unit for to write the test cases. So it was the not taking time, but that, uh, the the thing that was taking time is all covering all the scenarios. Like, the all the like, they can fill, uh, they they can fill the code. So the they they how I create the test cases.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using JUnit for unit testing is a standard practice in Java development. It's good to hear that you've focused on covering various scenarios to ensure robustness. When you're writing these test cases, how do you mock dependencies, such as databases or external services, and could you give an example of a challenging scenario you encountered while writing a test case for a service that had complex dependencies?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so for mocking, we've, uh, I was using, uh, what for that. So we use some, you know, annotations there to, uh, to mock the data the repository to to mock the particular class and the other, uh, and the other dependencies that we might use in a particular uh, test casing. So we we so this is how I handle the debt. And, uh, for the problems that, uh, what I was missing. So so in some of the cases which, uh, there was one time I faced a problem because I was using a strong annotation, uh, for a particular class. Uh, so yeah. So after finding it out, I made sure, uh, I never do it again. So this is our end of day.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Mockito is indeed a powerful tool for mocking dependencies in Java. It's good to know that you're familiar with annotations for mocking and have learned from past experiences, such as using `@Autowired` incorrectly. As you continue to develop your skills, what are some areas within Java or GCP that you're currently focusing on to further enhance your expertise?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So, currently, what I do is, uh, I'm, like, I I'm doing I'm solving all the problems, like, uh, what whatever I found it in, uh, in lead code. So I use Java for that, and, also, I am going through the documentation for Java. Uh, like, to cover cover more more features in in it, uh, in it to advance areas. And for GCP, what I'm doing is, like, I'm working to get another certification, uh, data engineer certification. So I will work for that.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you're actively engaging with competitive programming platforms like LeetCode to sharpen your problem-solving skills in Java. Pursuing the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer certification is also a commendable step to deepen your understanding of GCP's data services. How do you plan to apply the knowledge you gain from these advanced Java features and the data engineering certification to future projects or to enhance the systems you're currently working on?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what why I'm working for this, uh, is is to, like, uh, whenever I face any problem, uh, I am, like, I am able to solve it more quickly because of, like, whether doing the problem solving daily. And for if if it requires any cloud, so I I'm aware of all the services in GCP. So I can implement, uh, implement it more quickly and provide more solutions, uh, on the basis of a particular like, I I can give all the options options. Uh, the data might be available for particular use case. So that's why I'm working for this.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a strategic approach to skill development, aiming to be a more effective problem solver and solution provider. Being well-versed in GCP services will certainly enable you to offer a wide range of solutions to various use cases. As you continue to build your expertise, how do you stay current with the latest developments in Java and GCP, and could you share how you've recently applied a new concept or feature from either of these areas in your work?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what I do is, like, I I, like, I I read all the newsletters and also, like, follow all the take take post for the technology post for that, uh, for, like, for Java. So what I I do is, uh, like, for every few for new feature release, I go to his documentation and find out what's new in that, uh, version. So, previously, what we did in in our last project is, uh, we used our next So we migrated the platform like Java. We were using Java 8 before, so we migrated to Java 17, and we used some of the features like, uh, this is so sorry. Uh, we were, like, using Java, uh, previous version of Java. So we moved migrated it to Java 8 and implemented, uh, various, uh, new functions that that provided new features that provided data provided in Java 8. And for GCP, the like, uh, mostly, like, there there was no, like, in previously, there was no, like, a new feature released. But, yeah, I I think, uh, like, uh, we we I just worked on the AirEngine side as well.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Staying informed through newsletters, tech posts, and exploring new Java features by reading the documentation is a solid strategy for keeping your skills up to date. It's great to hear that you've recently migrated to Java 17 and have been able to leverage its new features. As you've made this transition, can you discuss how you've used any specific features from Java 17 in your recent project, and how they benefited the application or the development process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: No. Uh, sorry. Uh, like, uh, I, like, I've corrected it. Like, uh, I've been here, like, uh, I've, like, migrated from Java. Like, it was Java 1 to Java 1.8. Like, the 8 to Java 8, we were migrated. So, uh, I, like, we scaled related to Java 17. It was Java 8.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, migrating from Java 8 to a more recent version can bring significant improvements. Java 8 introduced many features like lambda expressions and the Stream API. Since you've worked with Java 8, can you tell me about a specific instance where you used a feature from Java 8, such as lambdas or streams, to solve a complex problem or to improve the efficiency of your code?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what we were doing is we were writing logic for particular, uh, like, uh, for retrieving a particular customer object, like, for retrieving all the customers from the database and, uh, sorting it and returning it. So it the data piece of code was, like, more more or, like, it was taking, uh, a huge lines were there. So so I moved the streams in place of that. Uh, it was just a one liner for that. So so the inside the stream also, uh, I used some functions of it, like the terminal and intermediate operations. I used it. And, also, you do the lambda in, uh, inside each of them, like, the fine tuning variables. So that that's how I handle the day.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a great example of how the Stream API in Java 8 can simplify and streamline complex operations. Using streams and lambda expressions to manipulate data is not only more concise but also often more efficient than traditional looping constructs. It's clear that you understand the power of functional programming in Java. Given your experience with Java and your ongoing learning in GCP, how do you envision integrating your Java programming skills with GCP's data services in future projects, especially considering the growing importance of cloud-based data solutions?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so, basically, what currently I'm doing is, uh, I'm, like, faster. Uh, we need to they'll so what Java does is, first of all, we have to create all like, implement the solution from the scratch. So after building it, I can use the the tools that are provided by GCP to, like, build the manager, deploy there. And for deployment, like, I I have also already done 2 certifications in GCP, like cloud developer and cloud architect as well. So I know the process, like, uh, we what we can do for, uh, putting the code over there and use cloud build for packaging, and we can use, uh, the different Google Google services for deployment as well. So for what data in a like, for the data engineering perspective, what I do is, like, uh, so I already did the, uh, like, looked into the development and the architecture certification. So to to, like, make my understanding more about data, NLL, uh, processing or the data, uh, engineering. So I'm going for data, uh, like, in an engineering. So what I can do inside that is suppose my application is creating a huge amount of data, it it needs to be processed. So I'm aware of all the steps and all the services that I can handle to process or, uh, to use in in a particular use case. So so suppose it is of Java, so it it might be more helpful for helpful for for me, uh, to understand all the thing and to suggest about what the use case what the solutions are and the options in the services that we can, uh, do do easier.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to integrating Java with GCP by leveraging your development skills in Java and then using GCP's tools for deployment is a solid strategy. Your certifications in GCP, coupled with your understanding of the development and architecture, will indeed be valuable in handling data at scale. As you continue to build your expertise in data engineering, what specific GCP data services are you most interested in exploring, and how do you plan to apply them to the data processing needs of your applications?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so so to move to a particular services, uh, I can like, I am currently looking into data flow, uh, cloud data flow. So what data flow does is, like, uh, it it, uh, like, it it is it creates pipeline, and it it, uh, it has to, like, take the data from one place to another place. Inside the data, we can, uh, we can perform many various transformation inside, uh, inside it as well. So it is it is it's like a very good, uh, migrating tool. So currently, I'm looking into it for that, like, uh, for in in my current steady plan.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Dataflow is indeed a powerful service for building data pipelines and performing ETL at scale. It's great to hear that you're focusing on Dataflow, as it aligns well with your data engineering aspirations. As you delve deeper into Dataflow, what kind of transformations or processing patterns are you most interested in implementing, and how do you anticipate these will benefit the data processing tasks in your applications?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so currently, I have just, uh, started to look into it because, uh, like, currently, it is in my study plan, but I'm aware of, like, what, like, a particular so suppose we have a cleavage team analytics. We are doing a, like, a issue. We are trading care trading issues, uh, actions on our website. So we have huge amount of data. And to process it, we can use, uh, the data flow streams for that, and we can perform we can, uh, like, we can, uh, remove the useless data and take only the data digit, uh, the important data, and we can provide the for further processing. So this is how I see, like, uh, a particular use case for data flow.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a practical application of Dataflow for clickstream data processing, where you can filter and process the data in real time. As you continue to learn and apply Dataflow, you'll likely discover even more ways to optimize data processing for various use cases. Given your experience with clickstream data, how do you ensure the security and privacy of this data, especially when processing it in a cloud environment? Can you discuss any specific GCP security features or best practices you've implemented or plan to implement in your data processing workflows?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. So we have some options like, uh, this is like, Google Cloud already, like, uh, stored the data into, uh, particular, like, encrypted form. And, also, we have some, uh, application. Like, if some suppose our our organization or me, uh, I want to encrypt it myself as well, so I can use a key key based, uh, encryption as well.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', \"Interviewee: View. Uh, yes. I'm ready to start the interview.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you're currently a Chegg Subject Matter Expert. Can you elaborate on the most challenging computer science question you've had to answer on the platform and how you approached solving it?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Uh, so the most difficult, uh, question which I encountered on the platform was, uh, coding question in which I had to design, uh, provide a code, uh, Java code related to the, uh, inventory system. And, uh, it contained many modules. So, uh, I had to search on Google and get the resources, uh, correctly to answer those questions very correctly and, uh, tackle the problem. Uh, somewhat, uh, there was an, uh, UIX present UX given by the student, uh, how the, uh, inventory system should look like. Um, and I was almost, uh, to get it correct. And, uh, I got a rating of 4.5 out of 5 on that question.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That sounds like a complex problem to solve, especially with the added challenge of designing the UI based on the student's requirements. How did you ensure the code you provided for the inventory system was efficient in terms of time and space complexity, especially considering the modular nature of the solution?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, so the, uh, the code was completely written by me on, uh, the, uh, Versus Code. And, uh, for the time complexity, uh, I checked it through the, uh, AI tools. I used some a r AI tools like GPT and BART so that, uh, I could check the complexity of my code. And, also, by looking at the modular problems, how the Versus code was giving the output and, uh, as as a, uh, our code editor, the code editor of which I'm, uh, which I used was Versus Code, and, uh, it provides a solution where, uh, you can get the time complexity as well as the space complexity by using the inbuilt extensions, which are provided, uh, in the code editor, actually.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Utilizing AI tools like GPT for code complexity analysis is an interesting approach. How did you specifically use GPT or other AI models to verify the efficiency of your code in terms of time and space complexity? Could you walk me through the process of leveraging these AI tools for code review?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, so, basically, what you can do is, like, you can copy, uh, copy your whole code and paste it on the, uh, chat editor of the, uh, GPT or any other AI tool. And you can ask it to, uh, generate the, uh, check the complexity and the, uh, uh, give output, uh, on the basis of that. And you can also use this AI tools to, uh, tell you what, uh, are the approaches in which you could have solved these problems. And you can, uh, reduce the time com complexity in certain modules or certain part of the code where you have used, uh, more time and, uh, you have taken more time to solve those approaches. Uh, so in this way, we can use the AI tools to solve the, uh, problem bigger problems in a shorter time duration and get more efficient solutions on that.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a creative use of AI for code optimization. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you led a class of 72 students as a Student Volunteer for the CodeChef Local Chapter. Can you discuss a specific strategy you implemented to help improve the students' understanding of a particularly challenging concept in programming?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Uh, so what approach I did follow was that, uh, in the certain week, uh, we were assigned, uh, we were many, uh, student volunteers, but the class which I was provided so the approach what I used was, uh, I made a WhatsApp group where I used to send, uh, the, uh, codes which needs to be solved within a week. And, uh, for the progress report, I used to, uh, circulate Google forms where the students could punch their progress, how many solutions they have solved, or how many not. And, uh, there was also a dashboard on the platform where we can, um, where we can, uh, check the progress report of the students, how much they have solved and how much not. And I also used to take feedback from these students regarding the problems they are facing so that this could be discussed in the classes, uh, with the faculty. And, uh, sometimes I also used to provide best solutions to them.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using a WhatsApp group for code sharing and Google forms for progress tracking is a practical approach to managing a large group of students. How did you assess the effectiveness of this feedback loop in improving the students' performance and understanding of the concepts?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: So, uh, basically, what happened was that, uh, if the student is lacking if suppose we were given 5 problems to solve in a week, if the student is not able to solve, uh, like, if the student is not solving a single question, we could approach him and, uh, ask what is the problem or what are the problems he or she is facing. If not, we could provide the online solutions. Or sometimes, uh, he could ask for quotes from student from another students or, like, from me, the leader, and, uh, try to solve those questions. And I I would, uh, I was happy very much happy to discuss those questions with him or her. And, uh, in this way, I used to tackle the problem of students not being engaging in the problem solving approach or if they are facing any difficulty. Because if the WhatsApp groups are made, they could have, uh, like, been a better way. And, uh, they could discuss their problems or they can discuss the solutions, uh, what other students have, uh, done and, uh, some are not able to do. In this way, uh, we used to tackle that.\\n'], ['Interviewer: It\\'s clear you were very proactive in addressing individual student needs and fostering a collaborative learning environment. Let\\'s delve into the technical skills listed on your resume. Can you explain how you\\'ve utilized C++ in the development of your \"Introvert Travelers\" website, particularly focusing on any design patterns or features that showcase your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP)?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, so the, uh, object oriented programming is more like the entity to be, uh, more to the real world. So the project, uh, uh, the most effective way in which I have used is, like, the c plus plus was to, uh, design my modular, uh, codes where, uh, I used, um, I need to be taken out for the inputs and output, uh, how the input would have been for the block channels, and how the file reading could have been possible. But, uh, the c plus plus language was not, uh, much more involved in the introvert traveler project, actually.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Understanding the project's scope, could you elaborate on a different project where C++ and its OOP features were more prominently utilized? How did you specifically apply inheritance, polymorphism, or encapsulation in that project to solve a particular problem?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: So the, uh, the next project which is mentioned on my resume is the, uh, smart dustbin. And the, uh, c plus plus was used in this, uh, language predominantly because the Arduino UNO, which is the, uh, embedded system. So it requires the coding to be specific into c plus plus language, where I use the concept of polymorphism, inheritance, and other OOPS concept to, um, make the project more efficient. And the project required was to, uh, like, the code you, uh, the code has to interact with the Arduino UNO and, uh, also access to the Internet. Also, uh, it has to send data or to, uh, through the tokens to the Ubidots, uh, like, open cloud where the data storage was, uh, made possible. So in this way, I used, uh, the c plus plus language in the smart Desmond project.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Incorporating C++ for an IoT project like the Smart Dustbin, which involves both hardware interaction and data transfer to a cloud platform, is quite challenging. Could you detail how you implemented polymorphism in the Smart Dustbin project to manage different types of waste or to handle interactions with the hardware and cloud services in a more flexible and efficient manner?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, so the basically, the hardware, uh, which we used was, uh, like, the air quality, uh, air quality sensor and the, uh, ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor needs to be, uh, more specific because when the Arduino UNO was, uh, on, it, uh, it actually, uh, take the input on the runtime environment. And, uh, if the Arduino UNO is on and the power supply is, uh, more to the, uh, the hardware components, the ultrasonic sensor, uh, has to capture the, uh, real time data and, uh, take the input and transfer it to Ubidots to the API token, and the data was stored on that. If the certain level and, um, there was a threshold, uh, set on the, uh, like, level of the, uh, dustbin where, uh, the ultrasonic sensor both 2 ultrasonic sensors were used, actually. Uh, 1 in the inside and one on the outside. And, uh, this was the more challenging part because, uh, you have to capture the real time data. If the, uh, code gives something error, this was needs to be handled. And, uh, if the, uh, we had, uh, we had set a certain level at which the, uh, alarm was to be, uh, taken, um, and the, uh, API Ubidots used to send, uh, email or an SMS, uh, to that, uh, that the dustbin has been overflowing, and, uh, it has reached to a certain limit. And same goes to with air quality index sensor.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Managing real-time data capture and response mechanisms with the ultrasonic sensors and the air quality sensor, along with the integration to UB Dots for data storage and alerting, sounds quite intricate. How did you design the system to be modular and extensible, especially in terms of adding or replacing components, without having to extensively modify the existing codebase?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So, basically, the code base was, uh, uh, so it was, uh, not a complete, uh, demonstrative project. It was a a prototype in which we had taken the Arduino UNO and the pre code, uh, predefined codes were taken. Just the, uh, modular part where we had to, uh, work on was to connect it to the API and, uh, also set the threshold, uh, work with the code where the interaction was more to the, uh, uh, Arduino UNO microcontroller. And, uh, the code needs to be, uh, sent to the Ubidots, and this was the more challenging because the data handling and the Ubidots is quite difficult.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Working with a prototype to focus on the crucial aspects of integration and functionality, like connecting to the API and setting up threshold mechanisms, is a practical approach. Given your experience with handling these technical challenges, how do you see the principles of OOP, particularly inheritance and encapsulation, being applied to simplify the code and ensure the system's reliability in handling complex operations?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Uh, so the, uh, encapsulation was, uh, that the, uh, API code or the tokens, which needs to be, uh, hidden from the, uh, from, uh, other users to be taken out. And, uh, this was, uh, this was the main, uh, challenge or the main task to encapsulate the API tokens, uh, which were very private to, uh, to handle. And, uh, in, uh, talking about the inheritance, the, uh, modular data of of the, uh, ultrasonic sensor needs to be inherited and, uh, given to the API tokens or, uh, uh, transfer it to the Ubidots. And, uh, this was the, uh, this was something where we applied the inheritance concept and also for the air quality index because both need to access the same tabular data, but the components were, uh, different. But the data types were same.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Focusing on encapsulating sensitive API tokens to ensure security is crucial in any system design. How did you approach testing and debugging these encapsulated components to ensure they functioned correctly without exposing the sensitive data? Additionally, in the context of inheritance, how did you manage the inherited data from the ultrasonic sensor and the air quality sensor to ensure it was formatted and sent to UB Dots in a consistent and usable manner?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So, uh, the, uh, encapsulation was the main task. So, uh, whatever happens is that, uh, on the Ubidot platform, there is a u uh, token generator. So on a particular purse if a particular person signs on the website, uh, uh, the unique token is generated in his or her name, and the same token was used to access, uh, and the same token was used in the code editor where the code, uh, contained the token and, uh, without the unique token from the, uh, particular user, uh, it cannot, uh, give up the data to, uh, any other person. If the code contains the different token, uh, it could become a quite challenging thing because, uh, it may hamper the, uh, encapsulation part and, uh, leak the data. And, uh, on the concept of inheritance, the, uh, there was not much more, uh, on that. But the data was stored on the table form, uh, format on the Ubidots because the separate modules were made on the platform to store separate data for both the components, ultrasonic and also the air quality.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Leveraging the unique token generated for each user from the UB Dots platform to ensure data integrity and security is a smart approach to maintaining encapsulation. Given the importance of data integrity and security, how did you approach testing and debugging the system to ensure that the correct data was being sent and received, and that the system remained secure throughout the process? Additionally, in managing the data stored in tabular format on UB Dots, how did you ensure that the formatting and storage mechanisms remained consistent and reliable for both the ultrasonic and air quality components?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So talking about the token generation, uh, the, uh, data was sent on, uh, through, uh, unique tokens. Uh, so the integrity was maintained, uh, somewhat. But, uh, as it was a prototype, um, I don't, uh, see any, uh, much more challenging thing at this point. If the project was to be implemented on a large scale, it could become a quite difficult task for maintaining the tokens and, uh, creating a secure environment for that, uh, but it could be tackled, uh, somewhere. Uh, at this time, uh, I'm not uh, able to think about a certain particular idea. But, uh, for sure, in future, uh, I will work on this. And, uh, talking about my, uh, talking about the tabular format of the data. So at a certain level, if the, uh, the, traction was to be, uh, for, uh, in the table, if the table goes on increasing for many days or for certain like, in a particular day, the ultrasonic sensor or the air quality sensor could have, uh, collected big data. Like, uh, if we go on to talk about, like, uh, each and every second someone could use these, uh, product or prototype, and the large amount of data could be generated. So in particular, the, uh, particular hour or days data could be, uh, deleted from the table and stored it into a different, uh, like, database for the particular hour. And the main table could be emptied, and, uh, the more data could be pushed on the, uh, Ubidot platform, uh, for to be storage in those, uh, data. And talking about the, uh, tableau format of how the data was stored for, uh, ultrasonic sensor. The, uh, data for the time, duration, and the height of the, uh, dustbin, how much it has been filled, and also the proximity of a person reaching to the certain, uh, distance, uh, near the dustbin was also tracked. And for the air quality, uh, the, uh, many, uh, like, gases, like, uh, how the concentration of the gas is changing around in the, uh, prototype. Uh, it was recorded on the Tableau format.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Considering the potential challenges of scaling up the project in terms of token management and security, what strategies do you think could be effective in maintaining the same level of security and data integrity on a larger scale? Additionally, your approach to managing data in a time-bound manner, by moving it to separate databases based on time intervals, is a good way to handle scalability and data management. How do you envision implementing data retention policies and ensuring efficient data storage and access in such a system?', 'Interviewee:']]}\n",

Uh, so what what we used is, uh, like, we we use various features of, uh, Spark. So, basically so what we do is we, uh, first converted all the base jobs into Spark jobs, and we used all the the best practices that needed to be in the, like, for cross joining, broadcast joins.

So this is how we make sure.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a comprehensive approach to the migration, focusing on best practices and fine-tuning. Testing is crucial in such transitions. Given your experience with Spark, how do you handle data skew or hotspots, and could you describe a scenario where you had to address this issue in your project?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so so there was a issue. Like, uh, when when we were joining, we have one table, uh, that contains billions of records. And there was a, uh, there was a small smaller table. It is joining with a small table, uh, which has, like, uh, maybe thousands of records. So, uh, so when we were doing this in the like, it is it was taking some time, uh, in the background. So what we have used in case of that is we use the broadcast giant. Like, uh, we, like, we we, like, dug it copied all those, uh, small tables into all the workers and, uh, and, like, and joined on the basis of that. So he did made, uh, made the operation more faster than So this is how we handle the the SKU. SKU.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using broadcast joins to distribute the smaller table across all workers is a classic solution to data skew in Spark. It's great to hear that you applied this technique effectively. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you've also worked with GCP. Can you tell me about a project where you leveraged GCP services, and how you integrated them with your existing technologies to solve a particular problem?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so the the yeah. There was a project, uh, which we have, like, created before. It was online in the grocery ordering system. So it was basically a website which contains various microservices. So we, like, deployed it, uh, through Jenkins and Docker. And after that, we have to, like, uh, implement it, like, put it on the cloud. Like, we have to migrate it to on place to cloud. So for that, we use the, uh, GCP for that. So what we do in GCP, uh, is basically we, like, uh, we use just all the compute instances and all the GCP services, which are required, uh, uh, which are required for our application to work there. So we use the compute engine instances. And so, basically, we we, uh, we had gone with the engine for that. So engine is, uh, standard mode, and we deployed our application there. So it did scale automatically, and this is how we intended.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Migrating a microservices architecture to GCP using Jenkins and Docker is a solid approach. You mentioned using Compute Engine instances. Could you elaborate on how you managed the deployment and scaling of your microservices in GCP? Did you use any specific GCP tools or services for load balancing, auto-scaling, or service discovery?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. So what we do, uh, what what what we did, uh, is we used the, uh, app engine service project. So we have created a app engine project in Google and deployed our service there. So it automatically in background, it automatically increases, uh, on the basis of load. So this is how and for load balancing, we used the global, uh, load balancer as provided. So so a a engine auto a engine automatically enters, load balancing as well. So we just deployed our application. It in a it took a lot of operational work from us and ended it.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging App Engine for auto-scaling and the global load balancer for load distribution is a smart choice for a scalable and resilient deployment. It's good to hear that you've had hands-on experience with these GCP services. Given your role in leading the development of the Online Grocery Store project, how did you ensure that your team's code adhered to best practices, and what kind of code reviews or quality checks did you implement to maintain high standards?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so so for the best practices, what we end up, like, we followed all the procedures. And, uh, from the documentation itself, we used, uh, like, we used what the procedures to be followed in code while writing code. And, also, we made sure to write test cases and cover whole classes, uh, in the test cases, in whole scenarios. And, also, after that, uh, we for for for after testing, we we have some senior senior members that took they they take the they took the code reviews for that. And the and if if they found problem, uh, it goes back to the developer, and the developer solve the that. And maybe go it goes back to texting, and then, uh, for the second code review, and it goes through this. So this is, uh, how the flow of the code review works here.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a thorough process, ensuring code quality through documentation, comprehensive test coverage, and peer reviews. It's great to see that you've incorporated these practices into your workflow. Speaking of test coverage, can you discuss how you approach writing unit tests for your Java applications, and perhaps share your experience with any particular testing frameworks or strategies you've found effective?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so for that, what what we do, uh, what we did here, uh, is, like, for every, uh, like, uh, for every services that we have created. So so for each classes, what we did is we created, uh, each test cases and write the test cases in j unit. So we used the, uh, j unit for to write the test cases. So it was the not taking time, but that, uh, the the thing that was taking time is all covering all the scenarios. Like, the all the like, they can fill, uh, they they can fill the code. So the they they how I create the test cases.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using JUnit for unit testing is a standard practice in Java development. It's good to hear that you've focused on covering various scenarios to ensure robustness. When you're writing these test cases, how do you mock dependencies, such as databases or external services, and could you give an example of a challenging scenario you encountered while writing a test case for a service that had complex dependencies?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so for mocking, we've, uh, I was using, uh, what for that. So we use some, you know, annotations there to, uh, to mock the data the repository to to mock the particular class and the other, uh, and the other dependencies that we might use in a particular uh, test casing. So we we so this is how I handle the debt. And, uh, for the problems that, uh, what I was missing. So so in some of the cases which, uh, there was one time I faced a problem because I was using a strong annotation, uh, for a particular class. Uh, so yeah. So after finding it out, I made sure, uh, I never do it again. So this is our end of day.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Mockito is indeed a powerful tool for mocking dependencies in Java. It's good to know that you're familiar with annotations for mocking and have learned from past experiences, such as using `@Autowired` incorrectly. As you continue to develop your skills, what are some areas within Java or GCP that you're currently focusing on to further enhance your expertise?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So, currently, what I do is, uh, I'm, like, I I'm doing I'm solving all the problems, like, uh, what whatever I found it in, uh, in lead code. So I use Java for that, and, also, I am going through the documentation for Java. Uh, like, to cover cover more more features in in it, uh, in it to advance areas. And for GCP, what I'm doing is, like, I'm working to get another certification, uh, data engineer certification. So I will work for that.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you're actively engaging with competitive programming platforms like LeetCode to sharpen your problem-solving skills in Java. Pursuing the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer certification is also a commendable step to deepen your understanding of GCP's data services. How do you plan to apply the knowledge you gain from these advanced Java features and the data engineering certification to future projects or to enhance the systems you're currently working on?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what why I'm working for this, uh, is is to, like, uh, whenever I face any problem, uh, I am, like, I am able to solve it more quickly because of, like, whether doing the problem solving daily. And for if if it requires any cloud, so I I'm aware of all the services in GCP. So I can implement, uh, implement it more quickly and provide more solutions, uh, on the basis of a particular like, I I can give all the options options. Uh, the data might be available for particular use case. So that's why I'm working for this.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a strategic approach to skill development, aiming to be a more effective problem solver and solution provider. Being well-versed in GCP services will certainly enable you to offer a wide range of solutions to various use cases. As you continue to build your expertise, how do you stay current with the latest developments in Java and GCP, and could you share how you've recently applied a new concept or feature from either of these areas in your work?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what I do is, like, I I, like, I I read all the newsletters and also, like, follow all the take take post for the technology post for that, uh, for, like, for Java. So what I I do is, uh, like, for every few for new feature release, I go to his documentation and find out what's new in that, uh, version. So, previously, what we did in in our last project is, uh, we used our next So we migrated the platform like Java. We were using Java 8 before, so we migrated to Java 17, and we used some of the features like, uh, this is so sorry. Uh, we were, like, using Java, uh, previous version of Java. So we moved migrated it to Java 8 and implemented, uh, various, uh, new functions that that provided new features that provided data provided in Java 8. And for GCP, the like, uh, mostly, like, there there was no, like, in previously, there was no, like, a new feature released. But, yeah, I I think, uh, like, uh, we we I just worked on the AirEngine side as well.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Staying informed through newsletters, tech posts, and exploring new Java features by reading the documentation is a solid strategy for keeping your skills up to date. It's great to hear that you've recently migrated to Java 17 and have been able to leverage its new features. As you've made this transition, can you discuss how you've used any specific features from Java 17 in your recent project, and how they benefited the application or the development process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: No. Uh, sorry. Uh, like, uh, I, like, I've corrected it. Like, uh, I've been here, like, uh, I've, like, migrated from Java. Like, it was Java 1 to Java 1.8. Like, the 8 to Java 8, we were migrated. So, uh, I, like, we scaled related to Java 17. It was Java 8.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, migrating from Java 8 to a more recent version can bring significant improvements. Java 8 introduced many features like lambda expressions and the Stream API. Since you've worked with Java 8, can you tell me about a specific instance where you used a feature from Java 8, such as lambdas or streams, to solve a complex problem or to improve the efficiency of your code?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so what we were doing is we were writing logic for particular, uh, like, uh, for retrieving a particular customer object, like, for retrieving all the customers from the database and, uh, sorting it and returning it. So it the data piece of code was, like, more more or, like, it was taking, uh, a huge lines were there. So so I moved the streams in place of that. Uh, it was just a one liner for that. So so the inside the stream also, uh, I used some functions of it, like the terminal and intermediate operations. I used it. And, also, you do the lambda in, uh, inside each of them, like, the fine tuning variables. So that that's how I handle the day.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a great example of how the Stream API in Java 8 can simplify and streamline complex operations. Using streams and lambda expressions to manipulate data is not only more concise but also often more efficient than traditional looping constructs. It's clear that you understand the power of functional programming in Java. Given your experience with Java and your ongoing learning in GCP, how do you envision integrating your Java programming skills with GCP's data services in future projects, especially considering the growing importance of cloud-based data solutions?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so, basically, what currently I'm doing is, uh, I'm, like, faster. Uh, we need to they'll so what Java does is, first of all, we have to create all like, implement the solution from the scratch. So after building it, I can use the the tools that are provided by GCP to, like, build the manager, deploy there. And for deployment, like, I I have also already done 2 certifications in GCP, like cloud developer and cloud architect as well. So I know the process, like, uh, we what we can do for, uh, putting the code over there and use cloud build for packaging, and we can use, uh, the different Google Google services for deployment as well. So for what data in a like, for the data engineering perspective, what I do is, like, uh, so I already did the, uh, like, looked into the development and the architecture certification. So to to, like, make my understanding more about data, NLL, uh, processing or the data, uh, engineering. So I'm going for data, uh, like, in an engineering. So what I can do inside that is suppose my application is creating a huge amount of data, it it needs to be processed. So I'm aware of all the steps and all the services that I can handle to process or, uh, to use in in a particular use case. So so suppose it is of Java, so it it might be more helpful for helpful for for me, uh, to understand all the thing and to suggest about what the use case what the solutions are and the options in the services that we can, uh, do do easier.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to integrating Java with GCP by leveraging your development skills in Java and then using GCP's tools for deployment is a solid strategy. Your certifications in GCP, coupled with your understanding of the development and architecture, will indeed be valuable in handling data at scale.

Uh, so so to move to a particular services, uh, I can like, I am currently looking into data flow, uh, cloud data flow. So what data flow does is, like, uh, it it, uh, like, it it is it creates pipeline, and it it, uh, it has to, like, take the data from one place to another place. Inside the data, we can, uh, we can perform many various transformation inside, uh, inside it as well. So it is it is it's like a very good, uh, migrating tool.

Uh, so currently, I have just, uh, started to look into it because, uh, like, currently, it is in my study plan, but I'm aware of, like, what, like, a particular so suppose we have a cleavage team analytics. We are doing a, like, a issue. We are trading care trading issues, uh, actions on our website. So we have huge amount of data. And to process it, we can use, uh, the data flow streams for that, and we can perform we can, uh, like, we can, uh, remove the useless data and take only the data digit, uh, the important data, and we can provide the for further processing.

Can you discuss any specific GCP security features or best practices you've implemented or plan to implement in your data processing workflows?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. So we have some options like, uh, this is like, Google Cloud already, like, uh, stored the data into, uh, particular, like, encrypted form. And, also, we have some, uh, application. Like, if some suppose our our organization or me, uh, I want to encrypt it myself as well, so I can use a key key based, uh, encryption as well.

So it requires the coding to be specific into c plus plus language, where I use the concept of polymorphism, inheritance, and other OOPS concept to, um, make the project more efficient. And the project required was to, uh, like, the code you, uh, the code has to interact with the Arduino UNO and, uh, also access to the Internet. Also, uh, it has to send data or to, uh, through the tokens to the Ubidots, uh, like, open cloud where the data storage was, uh, made possible.

The ultrasonic sensor needs to be, uh, more specific because when the Arduino UNO was, uh, on, it, uh, it actually, uh, take the input on the runtime environment. And, uh, if the Arduino UNO is on and the power supply is, uh, more to the, uh, the hardware components, the ultrasonic sensor, uh, has to capture the, uh, real time data and, uh, take the input and transfer it to Ubidots to the API token, and the data was stored on that.

So on a particular purse if a particular person signs on the website, uh, uh, the unique token is generated in his or her name, and the same token was used to access, uh, and the same token was used in the code editor where the code, uh, contained the token and, uh, without the unique token from the, uh, particular user, uh, it cannot, uh, give up the data to, uh, any other person. If the code contains the different token, uh, it could become a quite challenging thing because, uh, it may hamper the, uh, encapsulation part and, uh, leak the data. And, uh, on the concept of inheritance, the, uh, there was not much more, uh, on that. But the data was stored on the table form, uh, format on the Ubidots because the separate modules were made on the platform to store separate data for both the components, ultrasonic and also the air quality.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Leveraging the unique token generated for each user from the UB Dots platform to ensure data integrity and security is a smart approach to maintaining encapsulation. Given the importance of data integrity and security, how did you approach testing and debugging the system to ensure that the correct data was being sent and received, and that the system remained secure throughout the process? Additionally, in managing the data stored in tabular format on UB Dots, how did you ensure that the formatting and storage mechanisms remained consistent and reliable for both the ultrasonic and air quality components?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So talking about the token generation, uh, the, uh, data was sent on, uh, through, uh, unique tokens. Uh, so the integrity was maintained, uh, somewhat. But, uh, as it was a prototype, um, I don't, uh, see any, uh, much more challenging thing at this point. If the project was to be implemented on a large scale, it could become a quite difficult task for maintaining the tokens and, uh, creating a secure environment for that, uh, but it could be tackled, uh, somewhere. Uh, at this time, uh, I'm not uh, able to think about a certain particular idea. But, uh, for sure, in future, uh, I will work on this. And, uh, talking about my, uh, talking about the tabular format of the data. So at a certain level, if the, uh, the, traction was to be, uh, for, uh, in the table, if the table goes on increasing for many days or for certain like, in a particular day, the ultrasonic sensor or the air quality sensor could have, uh, collected big data. Like, uh, if we go on to talk about, like, uh, each and every second someone could use these, uh, product or prototype, and the large amount of data could be generated. So in particular, the, uh, particular hour or days data could be, uh, deleted from the table and stored it into a different, uh, like, database for the particular hour. And the main table could be emptied, and, uh, the more data could be pushed on the, uh, Ubidot platform, uh, for to be storage in those, uh, data. And talking about the, uh, tableau format of how the data was stored for, uh, ultrasonic sensor. The, uh, data for the time, duration, and the height of the, uh, dustbin, how much it has been filled, and also the proximity of a person reaching to the certain, uh, distance, uh, near the dustbin was also tracked. And for the air quality, uh, the, uh, many, uh, like, gases, like, uh, how the concentration of the gas is changing around in the, uh, prototype. Uh, it was recorded on the Tableau format.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Considering the potential challenges of scaling up the project in terms of token management and security, what strategies do you think could be effective in maintaining the same level of security and data integrity on a larger scale? Additionally, your approach to managing data in a time-bound manner, by moving it to separate databases based on time intervals, is a good way to handle scalability and data management. How do you envision implementing data retention policies and ensuring efficient data storage and access in such a system?', 'Interviewee:']]}\n",

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Hello. Hello.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great to have you here. I see from your resume that you've had experience with legal research using LexisNexis and Westlaw. Can you discuss a specific project where your research on these platforms was crucial to the outcome?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Platforms was crucial to the outcomes of the specific targets that I had to make.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a valuable experience. Could you elaborate on the process you used to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information you found on LexisNexis and Westlaw for these targets?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. So many of the projects that I had, for example, when I was writing a legal essay that was further published into my comment, a lot of the information that I had to use from were case studies legal briefs, different types of legal materials where having, like, this mess LexisNexis and Westlaw were essential, specifically in the form of finding codes, regulations, that type of information. And without it, I needed, to bolster, so kinda having Lexus nest eggs and Westlaw were essential to the publication of my article and a lot of the legal work that I have done since graduating law school from helping draft certain contracts from writing different memos. So it's been an important component in learning how to use the powerful systems.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've integrated these research tools effectively into your work. Shifting focus a bit, could you describe a particularly challenging aspect of using Zotero for organizing and managing your research materials, and how you overcame it?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. So specifically with Zotero, using it as, like, a a a tracker of a lot of my sources for different citations, things like that. It was the beginning, the biggest challenge was just learning how to use the software and then implementing it correctly within my research category or a collection of sources that I could input into whatever work product I was creating. For example, writing a legal research article incorporating the sources correctly, and the formatting of all of that, kinda more of the back end stuff. But overall, I was able to become pretty proficient with Zotero.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear how you've adapted to using Zotero effectively. Now, moving on to your experience at Small Business Utility Advocates, could you detail a specific instance where the policy recommendations you drafted led to a tangible change in regulatory procedures?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Absolutely. So one of the key functions that I have in this position is, reviewing different regulations that are kind of put out by the California Public Utilities Commission. And then through research, through different means of using, primary sources, secondary sources, and tertiary sources. What we do is kind of think about how this is gonna affect small businesses within primarily California, but more specifically within San Francisco area. In the Bay Area. And, one of the primary key results that I've been able to see through my work is, California is implementing a new, kind of regulatory rule making authority where they're looking for public comment and feedback, and I'm working on that and using the tertiary secondary sources, I've been able to, draft recommendations of how small business utility advocates should comment to the administrative law judge to make sure our clients, small businesses within the Bay Area, are adequately represented. And in doing so, they've been able to incorporate some of that feedback into the draft rule making. And though it's not published, a lot of the suggestions I've made have been kind of instituted and implemented within the draft rule making that will be for the proposed later\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your work on influencing regulatory procedures is quite impactful. Shifting focus back to your legal research skills, how do you approach the process of synthesizing information from a variety of sources to form a cohesive argument or recommendation, and could you provide an example of this in practice?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. I can. So one of the primary ways that I think about collecting and collating large amounts of information resources is you know, tracking that information, making sure I know my question, making sure I know my project, and then kinda annotating when I need to different avenues for collecting that information. So making sure I know within these 6 different rule making authorities or within these 6 different procedures, I can quickly kind of format, understand, annotate, I have an idea of where that information is, and then I'm able to kind of incorporate that within whatever writing component I might have. For example, I'm drafting a memo, I have all my sources within the document. I have my central questions, and then I can kind of start from a more broader point of view. And then as I write kind of narrow the question and within scope. So I've been able to do that through legal memos. Through my comments publication, through when I was a contract drafting attorney within the transactional world, a lot of that was germane going through different contracts to incorporate the necessary language within that contract. It was a key component of what I did, and how I was able to create legal effective work, and that was you know, making sure I had my sources, understanding the broader questions and themes. And then as I write, become more specific, using those sources and the question that I had in mind to answer for a client.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to managing and utilizing sources for different legal contexts is quite thorough. Now, I'd like to delve into the technical skills you've listed on your application. Could you explain a complex feature or function within Microsoft Office Suite that you've utilized in a professional setting, and the specific benefits it provided in that context?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So within Word, understanding the macro programs. So the formatting features, the functions, being able to use word on a high level is more than just being able to write text within the document. It's it's understanding how to quickly and efficient be organized documents, to make it appear nicer and more organized. And that goes from formatting 80 page papers using citations, all the robust functions within Word. But this also extends to PowerPoint, for example, understanding a lot of the macro features in PowerPoint to create a adequate presentation where it's organized You have your notes. You have the presentation. It's not too cluttered or clogged. And while I have good working knowledge of Excel, well, it is not close to the what I think the powers and capabilities are of itself, but I'm much more proficient within PowerPoint and within Word. And specifically within Word, making sure I know how to format organize documents, and all of the, powerful macro feed functions within that.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your use of macros in Word and PowerPoint is indeed a high-level application of those tools. Given your experience with legal research and the tools you've mentioned, how do you see the role of AI and machine learning evolving in the field of legal research, and what steps do you think should be taken to ensure the ethical use of AI in this context?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: I think it is absolutely part and parcel of legal research and kind of the incorporation of AI within legal research is super important. It's part and parcel to it. I see them kind of blending together and enhancing as a lawyer. As an attorney, the powers and functions and capabilities of my legal research. So it shouldn't be something that's shunned or something that shouldn't be used. It should be used to augment the capabilities of an attorney. So I think within the form of legal research, there's boundless capacity for it to be kind of incorporated, and I kinda wanna be on the edge of that because I think it's super important. For example, you know, if I'm researching, a case law, I can do a lot of my case law reading and review. However, that, you know, that's time consuming if I am able to use AI to more accurately track the cases that I need to use for regulatory compliance within a specific circuit within a specific district that's great. But if I'm able to draw more cases, with using AI, that's even better, and I think it'll help strengthen attorneys' legal research and writing capabilities.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given your perspective on the integration of AI in legal research, how do you think the current tools like LexisNexis and Westlaw could be enhanced with AI to provide even more value to legal professionals, and what specific features would you like to see in such an enhanced tool?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I think it can be more accurate in the sense of instead of giving you so many cases, they can give you less cases, more specific to the functions of what's happening. For example, if I type in energy regulation, within the Northern District of California, it'll pull up many different cases, some that are not germane But if you can classify the cases further, you know, if I'm looking for something within, electrical compliance instead of pulling up cases just related to energy compliance. They can pull up cases that are associated with electrical compliance and EV charging. Or it can pull up cases that, are tangentially related to that. So I think the biggest thing in AI is ensuring the accuracy and train of thought versus accuracy within word recognition, whereas the word electric or energy and it pulls up that case as opposed to understanding a deeper idea of what the case is about to incorporate that into the research algorithm would be super important.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your insights into the potential for AI to improve the specificity and relevance of search results in legal research are quite valuable. Shifting back to your experience with transactional law and due diligence, could you explain a particularly challenging aspect of due diligence in the context of Mergers and Acquisitions that you've encountered, and how you addressed it?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Absolutely. One of the most significant challenges is just ensuring that you've reviewed all of the relevant paperwork, documents, understanding if there's any title commitments or title issues within a merger and an acquisition. When you're, you know, working on an m and a case, for example, making sure there's not a section where within one of previous contracts that they have to get approval, and and it's just a lot of it's understanding the the meta analysis and kind of the the meta ideas and previous iterations of contracts, not just the current version you're working for. So for example, if you're working for a current entity, and that current entity was owned by 3 others understanding those contracts and the provisions that are still operable into the current contract and understanding who you need to get approval from, understanding the different contract components that kind of inhibit certain entity requirements if there's a voter shareholder or there's, different terms or ideas that are used the previous iterations of contracts, making sure they follow the same streamline of thought. Also, an an m and a is just working with, opposing counsel and understanding that you don't want to inhibit a relationship, but you also wanna represent the clients in the best of your ability. Understanding what to give up and what to give opposing counsel. In terms of drafting an adequate contract that, you know, makes both parties happy. So I'd say the 2 biggest challenges are understanding the previous contract iterations when you're doing due diligence to make sure you're crossing your t's and dotting your i's, making sure a lot of the work is, you know, legal germane and also adhering to previous contracts. So it's not opening up the client to any liability, but also working with your current client to make sure that they are not you know, giving too much of it in their interest.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your explanation of the challenges in due diligence for Mergers and Acquisitions is quite detailed. Now, considering your experience with contract drafting, how do you approach the task of ensuring that the language in a contract is both legally sound and clearly understood by all parties involved, and could you provide an example of a strategy you've used to achieve this balance?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Certainly. So one of the most important things within contract drafting is just ensuring brevity and conciseness. And know, there's accuracy within precision. So a lot of contract draft strategy that I use is taking a template contract, understanding what The main point of contention and the goal is ensuring that you're writing using specific words within shorter sentences that convey that thought and idea. There's no need for an 80 page contract as something could be done in 10. Understanding that all the key provisions are in there, and they're adequately addressed to the point. So I think the best contract drafting strategy is to be sure, precise with brevity. So that is one of the primary things within my contract drafting strategies.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your focus on brevity and precision in contract drafting is a valuable approach. Now, considering your experience with regulatory procedures, how do you stay updated on the changes in regulations, and could you describe a specific tool or method you use to ensure you're aware of these changes in a timely manner?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. It's a lot. It's through AI AI systems that send me news blast letters. I keep updated through LexisNexis through Westlaw. And within regulatory compliance where it's sending me different issues, day to day ideas, and changes within case law. And that's the primary tool I use, but also through the work that I do, a lot of it is updated daily. So I'm reading new rule making ideas. New public comments, kind of ideas like that. So I would say the way I say updated is through adequate information that's through news blast, through my work, just kind of ensuring that I'm I'm staying up to date with the regulations that are coming through. And the regulatory compliance ideas that are coming through through newsletters and through my work.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you have a comprehensive approach to staying updated on regulatory changes. Shifting back to your experience with legal research, how do you evaluate the credibility of sources, especially in emerging areas of law, and could you provide an example of a strategy you've used to ensure the reliability of such sources?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So ensuring the credibility of sources can come through. Several different ways. One of the primary ways that I look at is it's through you know, if we're looking at sources through primary means, ensuring that this study was conducted adequately, ensuring that it's being used in the appropriate manner. It doesn't wanna be know, kind of some nebulous idea, but is it actually stating an idea in our opinion? Then kinda taking a step back from that, has this source been used in other components? Like, if it's being used in legal cases, if it's an expert witness, then it's gonna attach more credibility to that idea. But even diving more into the background of that idea, I think, is important. In establishing the credibility of a source. But if it's just kind of more of a writing source, you gotta be careful with it. You gotta under you know, you gotta trust that if it's coming through a newspaper article, you gotta research the idea, the the journalist making sure that it's intellectually sound. So you know, if it's used in the legal context, it gives you more leeway as opposed to something that you just find on the Internet that's the source. So in assessing credibility, you gotta be you gotta be discriminatory in the way that you use it, understanding the ins and outs, the intellectual ideas, and going back to the root of it to really make sure it's credible at the end of the day.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to evaluating the credibility of sources, especially in the legal context, is quite thorough. Now, considering your experience with drafting expert testimony, how do you ensure that the complex legal concepts are presented in a clear and compelling manner, and could you describe a specific technique or tool you've used to achieve this clarity and persuasiveness?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So going back to making sure you understand the idea of you gotta understand the broader idea of what you're drafting in the persuasive brief. For example, I used some draft expert testimony for water rights in Louisiana, and I would talk with the scientific experts that were way above my expertise, but I had to incorporate you know, our legal positioning with their super dense scientific terms and ideologies. So it's making sure I understand understand what our key position is. Understanding what they're saying, understanding the nexus between what they're saying and that correlates to our position, stripping away the extraneous information that they provide, to help narrowly focus in within our legal goals and that's kind of the best way to do it. It's to understand the idea of what we have, you know, the broad issue, the idea, the specific component of what we need, and finding the information within an expert witness that scientific and kinda tying that into our very specific legal goal. And that's kind of the best strategy that I've been able to use.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: K. Great.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your background. I see you've worked as a Technical Lead at HCL Technologies and as a Software Engineering Expert at MERIT Data & Technology. Can you describe a challenging technical problem you faced in these roles and how you solved it?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: So as a software technical, uh, as a software engineering expert in the Merit Technologies, I faced your problems like, uh, uh, when we are, uh, integrating, uh, like, Excel as well as, uh, the sci fi side.\\n'], ['Interviewer: It seems like there was a connection issue. Can you please elaborate on the technical problem you faced during integrations and the specific solution you implemented?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Sure. So when we are implementing, like, uh, the project has been, um, like, built on top of dotnet core technology. And, uh, initially, like, it was designed in dotnet MVC and SQL Server. But when we are migrating the application to dotnetcore and post SQL to minimize the cost for the product, uh, we faced a lot of issues during the migration of the, uh, store possess. So to reduce the dependency of the store process, we moved all the logics to the, uh, dot net core itself and then EF core logic itself with the help of the link queue. So at the time, we faced some challenges as well as, uh, when we are moving to s 3 bucket, uh, for storage reasons, we faced some problems. And, uh, we have to upload a file image as well as, uh, Excel PDF, this format this kind of formats. So at that point of time, we need to validate whether the proper extension is there. Also, we need to process the file, and we need to convert it to your OCR format to, uh, copy the text with from that file. So for that, we created an orchestral solution orchestral solution, uh, to do the same. Because of the in the current, uh, project itself, if we do all the things in the same place, that might be a problem. Like, uh, the server might go down. Uh, in order to reduce that, we created an orchestral solution separately. And with the help of the service bus, uh, we sent the queue to another place. And from that, uh, we we we we were able to identify whether a new image has been come into the database or something like that. And based on that, we will process the file, and it will produce the output like a OCR to file OCR to PDF, actually. So that will be displayed to the end user. That's a\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive solution. When you moved the logic to EF Core for handling the business rules, how did you ensure the performance was comparable to the previous SQL stored procedure-based solution? And with the introduction of the S3 bucket for file storage, what specific challenges did you face in terms of managing and securing the files, and how did you address those challenges?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: When we are moving to EF Core, uh, from, like, uh, store browser to EF Core, there were some performance issues. So for that, we used a compile time queries, in the EF Core, which will help us to improve the performance, like, uh, like, better than the normal, uh, EF Core link queue queries. So since it's a compile time link queries, uh, we were able to, uh, like, retrieve the record in a faster manner, uh, like, which will, uh, provide, like, uh, improvements more than 3 to 4 times than the normal retrieval. So that was, uh, one of the option that we used, uh, to make these changes. And the second problem that we faced is s three bucket. So at the time of s 3 bucket, what are the challenges we face is we need to make sure the file that we are uploading to the s 3 bucket should be, like, uh, without any files or something like that. And they can use, uh, extension of any other file format types that we specified, but we want to make sure that the content of the file is same as the type specified. So for that, we have read the hexadecimal of the, uh, starting of the content. And based on that, we identify the the file which has been uploaded and the content are matching or not. And to ensure that file, we used, uh, antivirus scanner. ClamAV, I think. So that is one of the antivirus scanner which we used to scan the file, and then we we were able to upload the file to the SDK. So, initially, when the user uploads a file, we don't want to, uh, keep the user, uh, activating them. So, basically, when they are uploading the file, it will automatically upload to the S3 bucket. And from the S3 bucket, with the help of messaging queue, we will take the file, and we will check for that virus scan, and we will process the file. Once everything is completed, we will move the file to a different location. So that will be the final part. Using\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Using compiled queries in EF Core is a smart optimization. How did you manage the dynamic nature of some queries, especially those that couldn't be pre-compiled? And regarding the antivirus scanning process for files uploaded to S3, how did you handle the potential delay in response to the user, ensuring it remained within an acceptable range?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Question, uh, I'm not sure. So I'm just going move on to next question. So the second question is, as I mentioned, like, uh, we don't want to keep the user, uh, like, waiting for the response. So once they uploaded the file, we will just display the message like the file has been uploaded. And, uh, once it has been validated, you will get a a response. Okay? So in that case, once the file has been uploaded and the message queue process the file in an orchestral solution, uh, if the if everything is completed in a success way, we will, uh, send a success notification to the email address of the user. If anything fails, uh, like in the scan, if something fails and if there is any potential, uh, like, uh, infected files has been uploaded or any mismatched content present inside the file, we will, uh, reject the file, and then we will intimate the uploaded users that you are you have uploaded some, uh, like, not valid file or something like that, and we will send a message with the file name so that the user may have an option to reupload it once again. That's a\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a clear and user-friendly approach to handling file uploads and validation. Shifting focus a bit, could you explain the key differences in handling transactions between SQL Server and PostgreSQL, especially in the context of your application, and how you ensured consistency in data operations during the migration?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so when we are moving from the SQL operations to the post SQL, the transactions, when we are, uh, when we are updating our, uh, when we are updating multiple tables, at the time, we were going for the transaction. So since we are using EF Core, uh, so the EF Core already provides a transaction. So we are using we are creating a transaction, and then we are using the transaction, like, uh, to begin the transaction and commit the transaction if everything sucks using a try catch block. Suppose if the any failure happens in the cashback, we will roll back the transaction. So suppose if it succeeds, everything will everything will succeeds, or if it fails, everything will fail. So it, uh, the data will not be inconsistent, uh, when we are doing a transaction based update or insertion. So this is common logic. Irrespective\\n'], [\"Interviewer: How did you handle complex scenarios where you needed to ensure atomicity across both data manipulation and file operations, especially given your application's shift towards a more distributed file handling system?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: So I think there is a transaction scope level at the, uh, dot net in c sharp. So we can use the transaction scope, and, uh, we can, uh, do this. But apart from that, I am not sure. Using\\n'], ['Interviewer: Using TransactionScope in C# is indeed a way to manage distributed transactions. Given your experience with distributed systems, how do you approach the challenge of ensuring data consistency across multiple services or components in a distributed architecture, especially in the context of your .NET Web API and Blazor applications?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Um, so usually, when there are a different services or a different, uh, components, like, we will usually, uh, so as far as my I have a used, uh, application, if it is a microservice or a monolithic architecture, we were using, uh, an architectural pattern, and, uh, we were using a 3 tier approach. So where we have keep, uh, that transaction, like, for the repository interaction, we have keep the repository layer. So all the database operations will perform only on that particular layer. So if we are, uh, doing, uh, like, the data movement from the controller level, so it will obviously go to the business logic layer, which is a service layer. Uh, so from that service layer, it will move to the, uh, repository layer and, uh, repository layer, whatever the name naming convention is. And, uh, that infrastructure or repository layer will handle all the transactions related to the database. So over there, we will create a transaction, and we will hand it over it there itself. Suppose if you want to update a multiple microservices at the same time, at that point of time, we can, uh, use a transaction scope. And from one service to another service, we can communicate with the API caller or any, um, queuing services. And we will make sure, like, if one is succeeds, uh, everything should succeed, or else we will try to reverse it. Your\\n'], ['Interviewer: Your approach to maintaining transactional integrity across layers and services is well-structured. In the context of using TransactionScope across microservices, how do you handle scenarios where a compensating transaction might be necessary, especially in a distributed environment where failures can occur?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, actually, I need to research about it a little bit more. Absolute.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Absolutely, the concept of compensating transactions in distributed systems can be quite complex. It's often an area that requires careful consideration for ensuring data consistency and system reliability. Let's pivot slightly to a different aspect of your experience. You mentioned working with .NET MAUI Blazor. Given that this is a relatively new technology, could you discuss any specific challenges you faced while developing with it and how you overcame them?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So I have specified a dotcomovia. So that is the, uh, application I have, um, build it for my personal use. So, like, this is a, like, a share market kind of application. So where I I try to communicate with the, uh, API and try to pull that data off the stock market. And I just want to keep it for my personal use, uh, to customize my portfolio according to my requirements and how many stocks that I am buying on and how many stocks I am selling on, what is the day to day profit, and what is, like, uh, so I just want to maintain these kind of scenarios. So I thought, like, to create a mobile application, but, uh, so I'm familiar with the dot net technology. I preferred, uh, to learn on the dot net technology itself, so that's why I prefer dot net MAUI. So when using dot net MAUI, the challenges that I faced is, like, when I created a web application and, uh, so in dotnetmaui, I use a blazer support, uh, dotnetmaui. So as usual, I will create a Blazor application, and the dotnetmoi converts the Blazor application into mobile application. The only difference that I need to do is, like, uh, for the system specific, I need to create a desktop layout. And for the mobile specific, I have to create a mobile layout. But from the coding perspective, the challenge that I faced is, uh, when I try to hit a a website, which will give me the stock related data, So the cookie will change at, uh, certain intervals. So I need to first, uh, hit the, uh, URL. I need to get the cookie, and I need to use the same cookie to get, uh, hit the next endpoint, uh, to retrieve the stock related informations. So I have written a specific logic to handle that in the web application, but the same logic, when I moved it to the, uh, mobile mobile device services, like, when we are creating a dotenvoy project, so it will create each and every layer. So we will usually handle the common library, uh, where we can write all the common logics across, uh, the dotenvovia applications. And there are some specific, uh, scenarios that we have to write, uh, specifically for mobile, uh, desktop. So, likewise, I have used this cookie, uh, for the desktop and the mobile application, but it works fine in the desktop application. But when I'm moving to the mobile application, this was not working properly. So at that time, I found out, uh, there are some issues with this, uh, kind of logic, and some of them are not acceptable in the mobile based solution. So I just removed this piece of code and, uh, return the code in a different way, which helped me to, uh, run the application in the mobile to fix the stock related informations. Your\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your experience with .NET MAUI Blazor for personal project use is insightful. Dealing with cookie-based authentication and the differences in handling it between the desktop and mobile environments is a significant challenge. How did you pivot your authentication mechanism in the .NET MAUI Blazor app to ensure seamless stock data retrieval on mobile devices, considering the limitations with cookie-based solutions?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Since I developed with this application for my personal use, I haven't, uh, put any authentication for it. Uh, as of now, like, I am the only person who is going to use this application for my personal use. So this application basically, uh, lands on a home page, uh, like, uh, other application, like, uh, securities or some other examples I have seen. So where we can search, uh, the stock data in the home page, and there is a portfolio icon. So where we when we move to the portfolio, we can see the list of I stocks that we are in included and bought so far and what are the rates, uh, in terms of each and every day. The profits and the loss will be sort of over there. And, uh, I just kept, uh, want this, uh, app to intimate on a daily basis. It needs to check the stock details, and it wants to let me know whether I can sell the particular stock if it meets the required target. Because a day on daily basis, I cannot monitor these stocks. So that's the reason I have created this customized application to send me an push notification. Yeah. And one more challenge is the push notification. So push notification is available only for the mobile based application. And for the desktop application, we have different, uh, options, like to toast to notifications, something like that. So that that is also, like, uh, um, version specific. We have to design it. Focusing\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Focusing on a personalized, push-notification-driven stock management app is a unique approach. Given the differences in handling push notifications between .NET MAUI and Blazor, how did you manage the notification system to ensure you still received timely alerts on both the desktop and mobile versions of your app?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, so, basically, like, when we are writing the code in the, uh, dot net MAUI application, we have some, um, inbuilt methods, like, where we can find, uh, whether it's a mobile based version or a desktop based version. And if it's a mobile based version, it whether it's a Android based, uh, mobile application or iOS based or Tizen based. So it, uh, since they are supporting these kind of, uh, mobile device OS, so we can easily identify what are the, uh, OS, uh, that is currently running on. So based on that, I I have to write the code because some of the code, which is only supportable in mobile devices, uh, if we are writing at the common place when it is, uh, executed at the execution time, run time, it will throw the error because these codes are not supported for desktop. And, similarly, some of the desktop notification will not work in the mobile based application. So to, um, take this reason into the consideration, I have put the logic into this switch conditions. And based on that, I will try to identify, like, uh, which OS is currently running on. And based on that, I will just create, uh, uh, let me try this logic. Similarly, the database also will be different. The database creation also differ. So far, uh, we were using the SQLite database to store these datas, and it differs as well, like, uh, when we are moving to the different OS systems like, uh, iOS, Android, desktop, as well as Tizen. Adapt\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Adapting your .NET MAUI Blazor app's functionality based on the underlying operating system is a smart approach to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Could you elaborate on the specific considerations for database storage and management as you switch between operating systems, especially in terms of ensuring data integrity and performance across all platforms?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: This application, like, is, uh, what to say? Uh, as of now, uh, I have designed it for my own use. Uh, So the reason I have used the SQLite databases, the SQLite database, when we are using it in the mobile application, it will store the data in the SQLite database, and it will be used on the particular device itself. So I don't want to, uh, go for the next level of approach, which is a cloud related database. So when I am using the cloud related database, I can use a common data for all the platforms. But when I'm using a SQL like Russian, so it will create a database in that particular system, and it will maintain this data only on that particular operating system. So the data cannot be, uh, shared in other systems. So if we want to, uh, move to the next level, then we have to use some cloud based database. And based on that, uh, the data will be, uh, shared across all the systems. But, uh, I this is for my personal use, so I haven't, uh, choose that option because it's a there is some cost involvement over there. So I don't want to go for the cost involvement while during the development. So I used the SQL database in that part of time. Your\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your decision to use SQLite for local storage in the .NET MAUI Blazor app makes sense, especially considering it's designed for personal use. Could you discuss the trade-offs between using SQLite for local storage and transitioning to a cloud-based database in terms of data access speed, scalability, and potential features that you might gain or lose in the transition?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Oh, so I'm I'm not about the not aware about the complete features of it. But when we are using some cloud-based database like what are the advantages of it is we can use the same data at any other places. When we have to synchronize the data, first of all, we can use any offline database like sqlite or something like that like to store the data in offline system. And when we connected to the internet, then we can synchronize the data to the cloud based system so that it will get this synchronized data. But one thing we have to make sure is that cloud provider should be up and running so far that we have to ensure like we are using a like the serviceability like there are some other features like to ensure like 19.9% availability of the database to make sure during this synchronization. The data should not be lost under the database should not be down at that point of time. So that might involve a different scenario later that cloud later on things like Greater than c local copy. So there are so many other things are.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

            "### Candidate A has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate A Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've had significant experience with strategic projects and business growth at Unacademy. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you managed there and how you navigated the challenges? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So in May 2022, we were facing a challenge in revenue growth. So our growth was snagged. And, uh, especially in April May, the category was degrowing by 3%. So we had to come up with ideas that, uh, using which we can grow the category, especially in terms of revenue. And but the main point was we had not we were told not to increase the costs incurred to get that revenue numbers. So we brainstormed the team and came up with an idea of iconic mentorship program in which we fine tuned the sales pitch of our of, uh, of our sales team, and we also got in touch with, uh, the sales team to understand their feedback. What what is the problem that they are facing in in getting the sales done? In the same way, we we also that we also did a market research to understand what our customer base was looking for. And so we figured out that they're looking for a mentorship program with our product. We launched that program in less than 45 days. And this once this program was launched without incurring any additional cost using the resources that we already had, using the online contractors that we had. We ensured that the the product was launched as an additional feature with a little more as I've been with a with a little more changes in the SKU price, and then this resulted in great success. In the coming quarter, the category grew by 13%. So in this way, we navigated the degrowth in the category with without incurring any additional cost with a greater customer satisfaction ratio.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's an impressive turnaround, especially without increasing costs. It sounds like you have a strong grasp on both the sales aspect and the customer research side of things. Given your experience with the UX team in resolving learner issues, how do you approach the balance between user experience and business objectives when making decisions about product features? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Right. So these two things go hand in hand, user experience and the sales or we can say revenue growth. Uh, to keep things in perspective, uh, my from my experience, until the customer is satisfied, they'll not return and will not get the word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth is a publicity without spending any single penny on the advertisement and the marketing costs. So customer success is very important. On the other hand, once we connect to the customers, we also understand what our real use users want and what they are ready to pay for, Especially to understand things, uh, from an Indian buyer point of view, they are very, very conscious about the prices of the product and the services that they're paying for. So until they are satisfied to the core, they'll not return as a customer. And especially at Unacademy, we divide revenue into 2 streams. That is new revenue and the renewal revenue. So new revenue is the revenue from the leads or from the customers that has signed up that have signed up with us for the first time. On the other hand, the red renewal revenue means that these are the same customers who are returning to renew their subscriptions. So, uh, keeping things very short, uh, so it's very important to strike a balance between the customer success and the UX side of things. Uh, so how would how do we do it? So we do it based on the data that we have. So we have a ticketing software called Freshdesk in which we categorize the inbound ticket flow into different categories or different verticals. Let's say, from the UX point of view, if the customer if the user is asking for, a specific feature on the app. And let's say 45% of user asking for one particular feature, but 23% of users are asking for another feature. So we would implement the feature of which 45% of tickets have come from come for. So based on this, we sit with the product team and then we change the user interface or the product in all. So this this goes not only with the product, but but also with the content that we have on the app.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very data-driven approach, and it's clear you value customer feedback highly. Considering your background in analyzing business KPIs and performing revenue projection, can you walk me through how you approach setting KPIs for a new project and ensuring they align with the overall business goals? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So as a part of the growth, especially the revenue growth team, we have an overarching, influence over all the levels of the category. That could be GTM. That could be YouTube Pro. That could be customer acquisition. That could be the marketing cost or the performance marketing cost that that we incur. Having said that, how do we, uh, calculate the KPIs or how do we define the KPIs for a new project that that's coming up? That's a very interesting question. So it is based on the product that we are having all in all. So, for example, let's say we have to launch a category. I'll give you a real life example that happened. So we had to, uh, launch a specific product for a very specific target segment. For that, we had to, uh, do all the research, uh, and all the marketing and lead acquisition from scratch. So what we did was, uh, we launched a YouTube channel to understand to connect with our user base for a free marketing campaign. And then, uh, once this was done so once we once we call about YouTube, for for YouTube, the KPIs are the number of views, the number of subscribers that we have, and the percentage of videos, percentage video was. So, for example, a a video is of 10 minutes. Let's say, uh, user so cumulating, we have an average of 45% viewership. That means viewer watches it for 4 and a half minutes. That is API. So if the content is not interesting, the user are not watching your videos, that cannot be pushed by the YouTube algorithm. So that that is one KPI. For example, if the project is YouTube, the KPIs could be views, subscribers, uh, watch time, and, uh, the leaderboard. So we once we launch any, uh, new new channel on YouTube, we also keep a very close track of our competitors. YouTube leaderboard that is updated daily analytics team that, uh, so I have an analyst reporting to me. So so my way of working is that we keep a track on our competitors very well. So every video that we upload and every video that they upload, we have a neck to neck competition so that we can understand what is going on in the market. So for example, for for YouTube, the KPIs are views, subscribers, watch time, and are are ranking the leaderboard. On the other hand, let's say we have we are talking about in GTM, let's say, of pretest or a GTM event that we have done. So for that, the the KPIs could be enrollments that we get, the number of actual test takers or actual football that we have in that seminar or with that particular GTM that could be KPIs for that. Uh, going on a strategic scale, let's say we are launching\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you have a comprehensive strategy for setting KPIs and tracking performance against competitors. Given your experience with implementing lead segmentation and revenue triggers, can you explain how you utilized segmentation to improve your marketing efforts and what kind of revenue triggers you found most effective? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So a lead segmentation is a very important part of my job. So we have different kinds of leads that different kinds of users. So we are sitting on our user base of 2,000,000 users, 2,000,000 free users to be precise. More than 2,000,000 free users. Now all these users don't have the capacity to pay for our product. That we understand very well. So a conversion rate of x percentage, let's say. Now let, uh, we also understand that a user who's coming on our platform is also, uh, going on different other platforms of our competitor. So we do a behavioral segmentation of leads. That's 1. To understand that if, uh, so we categorize in the in the behavioral segmentation part, we categorize leads into abandoned cart. That is if the user has added the product in the, uh, added the product in the cart and then he has abandoned the cart. Another is That is payment payment failure. If the lead is trying to pay for the product and the payment is not going through, that's also a set of leads or or a set of cohort that we have. Another is that, let's say, a user is applying a discount code on a particular product, and then he's leaving the leaving the payment page. So from from that, we have a segmentation. We are able to understand that this particular need need set or this particular cohort size or this segment is looking for more discounts on the product. So we can roll out, uh, discounts of that sort. Now coming on, uh, revenue triggers. So discount triggers works the best for us. Value often triggers are are second on the number. So discount triggers so our product is really good. Our content is really nice. It's one of the best in the market, if not the best. So, uh, discount triggers work very well. Uh, in particular, discount triggers, we have seen a revenue growth of more than 45%.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very targeted approach to lead segmentation and it's impressive to see such a significant revenue growth from discount triggers. Given your technical background with a B.E. in Electronics and Communications, how do you leverage your technical skills in your role as a business growth professional, especially when it comes to understanding and utilizing data for strategic decisions? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So, uh, data is the soul of all the decisions that we make. It could be the revenue based decisions. It could be the decisions on decisions on YouTube. It could be decisions on GTMs. It could be decisions on P and L management. So we have, uh, these Tableau dashboards for everything for, uh, our watch time, for our learners, for for our YouTube growth, for our revenue, for our segment wise revenue, for our discount trigger based revenue. So we use Tableau dashboards extensively to, uh, dig deep into the data that we have, to understand and to fetch insights from the data because that is what the higher leadership is looking for, to understand how are we growing, how is how is the category going, growing, which which, uh, SKU is performing better, which SKU is not performing that good. So, uh, Tableau dashboards are one very, I'm sorry, very specialized technical tool that we use. Another is the Google Sheets. Google Sheets, uh, is something that we use very extensively in, uh, very extensively in our day to day operations. The other thing is, uh, more more often than not designing softwares, uh, Sigma and Canva that are used very extensively for all the communications that we send. Another applications that we use is WebEngage. WebEngage is not used by me directly, but I have a team of of associates that that send all our communications. Uh, using these Tableau, sometimes SQL, and, uh, Google Sheets. My technical background has helped me out to get get very well into these, uh, data digging the data analysis rules to fetch valuable insights.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your technical proficiency clearly plays a crucial role in your ability to analyze data and communicate insights effectively. Utilizing tools like Tableau, Google Sheets, Figma, and Canva demonstrates a versatile skill set. How do you ensure that the insights from these data analysis tools are effectively communicated to and acted upon by cross-functional teams, especially when it involves technical details that need to be translated into actionable business strategies? \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. So that's a very important part of category crew to to convey the message to the senior leadership that what is happening in the categories in term happening in terms of numbers, and to the other cross functional teams to make the mission statement very clear to them that what we are chasing or what we are after. Because if the mission statement is clear, all the teams can put their best to for the achievement of the goal. Now having said that, coming to how do we do it. So we do it in a very segmented manner. So, for example, if it's revenue, we do a complete end to end analysis of every SKU wise revenue, day wise revenue, auto wise revenue, week wise revenue, and month wise revenue. Now once we have this data that the revenue is growing for this particular SKU in this month, in this, uh, week. So now then we try to dig in that why has this happened. Have we given a special discount on that particular SKU, or we have given an extension or or a free extension on that particular SKU. So then we understand that, and then the same thing is translated to the other teams and, uh, senior leadership as well. Cross functional cross functional, uh, communication also plays a very important role because once we have so I'm also acting as a key account managers for very critical accounts in the organization or in the category. So we have these external contractors who work in whose whose payments are done in hours. So to communicate them that this many hours has been utilized, and we would like to use these many more hours of yours. This is done using the Tableau dashboards again, and this is communicated in both written as well communication is done so that, uh, external contractors will also happen because these are very crucial stakeholders in our operations.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's evident that you place a strong emphasis on clarity and transparency when communicating data insights to both internal teams and external stakeholders. Your approach to segmenting information based on the audience's needs and the use of both written and verbal communication to ensure understanding is commendable. How do you measure the success of these communications, and how do you adapt your strategy if the desired outcomes are not being met? \\n\", 'Interviewee: So to measure the success of all the communications that happened, So we can we do it in for most of the cases, we do it on a real time basis. For example, if we have communicated that this particular creative has to be changed and the team has not understood or they have not understood the essence of what we have been trying to communicate. We sit on a meeting with them, and we try to understand that what they have, and we try to communicate it again because, um, which when, specifically when you come to creative generation or something that that involves, uh, designs or videos to so communication plays a very important role. We have to sit again and again with the person without getting without getting irritated because, uh, to trans to transmit or to communicate that particular idea that what you are thinking and what you want to a person who does not understand the category very well. Maybe it could be a designer, mostly a designer, or some or a person from other team or other category. So you have to sit with them. You have to understand their mindset. Where are they coming from and where are you coming from? And then you have to sit with them too. And you have to come basically on a same page. Uh, having said that, uh, the another thing that is very important in case if, uh, the communications are not done properly. You have to sit sit again with them and explain it to them. So deliberation and discussion is the key for the success in in operational cases and also in planning.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Your approach emphasizes patience, collaboration, and iterative communication, which is essential for ensuring that complex ideas are understood and executed correctly. It's great to see that you value the process of aligning with team members from different backgrounds and expertise. Given your role in strategic projects and business growth, how do you stay informed about industry trends and integrate new insights into your strategic planning process? \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. So, uh, we have this culture in our team that anybody who gets news about anything, any new dynamics that is coming to play for our business, that is the active business. They keep on posting that links on our internal communication channels so that we we we can keep ourselves appraised about the the the Dynamics change or any other feature or any competitor that has got funding that has got funding. So in this way, we keep ourselves appraised with the latest industry trends and any new market dynamics that is coming into play.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a proactive approach to staying current with industry developments. Encouraging team-wide sharing of information ensures that everyone is on the same page and can contribute to the strategic planning process with the latest insights. How do you evaluate which trends or market dynamics are relevant to your strategic projects, and how do you prioritize their implementation into your business growth plans? \\n\", \"Interviewee: So I'll give you example from from last year. 1 of our competitors got a funding of around $1,000,000,000. And, uh, as soon as this news was broke out to us, then we, uh, we got into a team meeting. We got into a hard long Slack. And then we figured out that this particular competitor has 6 different categories on that time. And let's say they they want to double their category numbers. So let's say they are launching to a 6 more categories. That's in all in all, they'll have 12 categories. Now how how what kind of a market share do they have in our business? We calculated that. And based on that, we try to estimate how much money can they actually pump into the market to bleed the market. That could be 1. Or for lead generation, that could be another. Uh, by bleed the market, I mean, they could reduce the prices of their products to such a level that it would be it would be so competitive that a learner would not have any other choice than opting for their their courses or products. So once this was done, it was a post priority for us to because we cannot reduce that price. We could not, uh, reduce our SQ prices to our competitors. So we we maintain that qualitative edge. So we once they have received funding, they would also try to poach our external contractors. So we, uh, escalated this way in advance, maybe 40 days in advance to our leadership, and we got special financial approvals and offered special incentives to our external contractors that to ensure that they are not pushed. We also did some changes to their agreements, and we we had a lock in lock in clause that was put in into their contracts. In this way, we prioritize that our contract our external contractors, our our educators are lost in the game. On the other hand, we also understood that the kind of marketing campaigns and the kind of the kind of market share that we will lose in the coming quarters are, uh, is due to this sudden influx of money into our competitors' bank accounts. And so this was already communicated to our senior leadership so that they do not get worried and they cannot get walked up. And this is also communicated to all our junior associates, so that they do not lose hope in our product and our business. In this way, we prioritized and we, uh, we ensure that our business stay robust and, uh, we can grab the market share that we have, or we can also reclaim the market share after the coming quarters once we once the competitor has done the kind of operational the kind of marketing or money pumping in the market that that they were planning.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: You? Yes. I am. Thank you.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at Rampiva Legal. You mentioned signing the company's first vendor channel partner. Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced in establishing this partnership and how you overcame them?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, a channel partner, as you probably know, is the partner that's gonna sell your product for you. And, uh, in this particular instance, uh, there was a a company that was consulting with other law firms and other companies, mostly other companies in the in the construction field. And, uh, they processed with the same processing engine, which is Nuix. And, uh, I knew some people there. So I was able to take my personal relationship with them as, uh, as an in, if you will, you know, establishing some trust based on our our prior relationship, our prior performance. And, uh, uh, yeah, I was able to start talking to them. And after, uh, they agreed to take a look at the product, vet it, uh, the the product spoke for itself. It's a good product, and they were happy with it. So it it overcame that kind of initial resistance of, um, offering something they hadn't offered before.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant achievement. When it came to vetting the product, how did you address any concerns the partner may have had about integrating Rampiva's solution with their existing workflow, especially considering the unique needs of the construction industry?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Well, more properly, the unique workflow is the Nuix processing engine. Nuix is an engine that processes data in the discovery. It then goes into a hosting review platform and a number of AI and and tar tools as well.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a thoughtful approach to addressing these concerns. Can you elaborate on the technical aspects of integrating Rampiva's solution with the partner's existing workflow, particularly how you communicated this to the partner to build trust in the solution's compatibility?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. And I I guess to preface that by saying, I'm not the the technical, uh, consultant on that. I understand the technology, but, uh, you know, at that fine level, we have, uh, uh, subject matter experts. But the key thing here is that, uh, when Nuix processes, it's a very powerful tool, but it's a very cludgy tool. It's very difficult and very high maintenance. So when it came to integrating with their workflow, what we're able to show them is you have this very complicated workflow, uh, uh, in order to take advantage of all the, uh, the firepower, all the technology that you have in in processing. And by using the Rampiva, you're gonna get more out of it easier. So, uh, it's easier for staffing, uh, it's easier in terms of budgeting. And, you know, the key the key thing that grease the wheel, if you will, is that, uh, it allowed them to make far more efficient and economic use of something they already had.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the high-level technical aspects is definitely crucial for effective sales. Shifting focus a bit, in your role at Ryley Carlock & Applewhite, you led a team of approximately 8 members in eDiscovery and Managed Review. Can you discuss a specific challenge you faced in leading this team and how you addressed it?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, I think the biggest problem that team had was their value proposition, if you will. That's what makes what they were doing better than what other people doing the same thing were. So for example, their their value\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding and differentiating the value proposition is key. How did you work with your team to clearly define and communicate this value proposition to both internal stakeholders and clients, ensuring everyone was aligned on the unique selling points of your services?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think internally, uh, they understood it, uh, instinctively, but they didn't really, uh, were able to, you know, render it into something that was easily described. The the value statement for Riley Kerlock's managed review is that it was a law firm quality review, uh, at a discount price. There's different levels of review in the managed review business. You can get, you know, quick, cheap, and dirty overseas. You can get highly technical for things like IP and patent that is very expensive. So they were kind of, um, that law firm level review. That's a good level of review, a sophisticated level review, but kind of at a bargain price. So one of the problems they were having is they were, uh, competing for projects that didn't align with where their value proposition was. Some of them were either too technical or some of them were either, uh, uh, too cheap. They didn't need the value that we had, so they didn't need to pay for it. So the thing to get them working properly was to align, uh, the targets, align the the targets potential customers with the offering that we had. And the way that is done is by, uh, coming up with a marketing plan that targets the right kind of client. The client who, if they were in a position to say yes, it would make sense for them to do so. And that that kind of uncorked the dam and allowed them to start expanding.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Aligning the target market with your value proposition is crucial for business growth. Can you detail the specific components of the marketing plan that helped realign your target clients and expand your business in the right direction?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: No. I think I I think I have to a degree, but I can I can kind of reencapsulate them if you will? Uh, we were looking for clients that needed attorney level review. And, you know, review doesn't have to be done by attorneys. It can also be done by very sophisticated subject matter experts. So we were looking for certain types of review. Usually, a construction, as I've cited, is is 1, general business litigation, you know, things like this. By identifying the, uh, where our values showed up the best, we were able to go and look at practice groups and law firms and go, okay. They do the kind of work that is the kind of work that we're looking for. So by talking to them, we can discuss projects they've had or may have that, uh, could benefit from getting that attorney quality review at a lower price. That makes them more cost effective and more competitive with their clients.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Identifying practice groups and engaging with them to discuss specific projects is a targeted approach. How did you leverage technology or data analytics to identify these practice groups and evaluate the potential fit of their projects with your service offering, ensuring a more data-driven and efficient client acquisition process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: There's a number of ways to do that. Um, you have to kind of look in 2 large different categories. Larger law firms have a series of practice groups. They'll have some practice groups that are good targets and some that aren't. So if you look at the a law firm, you might say, well, some of this law firm isn't a good practice for is it a good target for me? But if I look at this law firm, if I look at the information that's available through various sources or even going as simple as going to a firm's website and saying, okay. What practice groups do they have? Are these practice groups that are good for us? They are. Then let's reach out to them. Then that's for kind of a general purpose law firm. The the second approach, uh, of kind of leveraging, I guess, you could say analytics, is looking for firms that specialize in these fields. And, yeah, there's a number of tools that are available for that that are relatively simple. And if you've been in the business marketplace for law long enough, there's some that are gonna come to mind. So that kinda gave us a good idea of who to target.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the different approaches to targeting law firms and specialized firms is insightful. Can you delve into the specific tools or methodologies you used to evaluate the fit of a practice group or a specialized firm, perhaps highlighting a tool or strategy that particularly stood out for its effectiveness in this process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I'd have to say it's not so much a tool because they're not that difficult to identify. You can look at a firm's website, or you can look at, you know, what type of law firm it is. It might say, we specialize in construction or mass tort or whatever it might be. Um, but I think it's more of an approach. Right? Uh, what was helpful in that instance was in identifying, uh, firms that did that kind of work was, uh, taking a consultative approach. And that's, I think, you know, the thing that you're asking, right, is what what process do you use? And in a consultative approach, we're gonna ask a lot of questions. We're gonna be lawyerly ourselves. We're gonna ask them about what they do and how they do it and where their pain points are and see if their pain points align with the offering that we have. If they do, we've gone a long way, uh, down the process of identifying someone who could be motivated to purchase our services. So that that takes, um, you know, some some some digging. And more importantly, it takes some listening rather than, you know, letting them talk rather than than you talk at them. Let them explain what their problems are. So I think a key thing there is the consultative approach.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The consultative approach to client engagement is indeed a powerful strategy for identifying alignment and addressing pain points. How do you ensure scalability of this consultative approach across your sales and client services teams, especially as the business grows and the number of engagements increases?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, the, you know, the number of engagements can increase. The size of the individual engagements tends to remain more constant, at least in the business that I was in. But even in businesses where it's not, right, some law firms might have, 1 or 2 projects a year. Some might have 1 or 2 a month. Um, it's simply a matter of asking the right questions to the white people, and then encouraging to provide you with the information where you can then go to your solution. You can go to your well of information and say, hey. I can help you here. You've laid out to me what you're doing and how you're doing it and where where the pain points are or you know, with a consultative approach, they may not realize they have pain points. They might be doing something and thinking, yeah, it works fine, when you're like, wow, they don't really realize this could be done much more efficiently. So, uh, that's, uh, you know, in terms of scalability, I think it it's simply a matter of, uh, whether the whether it's a large target or a small target, the approach and the process is the same. Of course, as you expand and you add more people, you have more people doing it. So, uh, you know, there's a practical limit, I think, ultimately to how much one person can can juggle. And that varies on a lot of factors that, you know, probably aren't worth going into right now about about the particular business itself.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the consistency in approach regardless of the size of the engagement is important. What kind of tools or methodologies do you envision implementing to help your teams better capture, analyze, and utilize client data to enhance the effectiveness of the consultative approach at scale?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think what kind of tools or processes would I would I, uh, use? I think, you know, part of it is teaching people to listen, teaching them to not just talk at clients of, hey. I have this, this, and this to sell. A lot of people try to I guess they call it feature sell. It's like, this is all the neat stuff that we have, and isn't it great? The problem that you can run into is that your stuff might be great, but if they don't have a need for it, you're wasting each other's time. So I think training might be, uh, one of the key things is teaching people what questions to ask, techniques to get people talking, and identify the right people to talk to and getting them to provide you, uh, the information in a in a give and take. You know, my background is an attorney. Attorneys are are trained to ask questions. Um, and I think people think, you know, they're trained to ask tricky questions, but we're not. We're really trained to ask questions to try to get to the truth of a point or matter. So, you know, there's a a variety of training programs available, but I think that's kind of the key thing is having people who are trained in the consultative approach that know how to use a consultative approach, how to implement it by the type of questions they ask and the process by which they go about their engagement. I think that's the key, and that's the thing that allows you to expand the scalability. And, you know, you can always expand the number of people, uh, on a particular project. You know, you might have a a smaller project and, uh, uh, you know, one person can handle it. But on a larger project, just prospect, you might wanna bring in some subject matter experts. There might be more stakeholders in this in this larger, uh, project. You know, there's a lot of factors that are I hate to sound lawyerly. It's one of those kind of it depends questions. Uh, but, uh, it it depends on a a lot of factors that we that we don't know as you and I are sitting here talking right now about what would what would make us determine what we need to put that consultative approach into effect.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Training and developing a questioning mindset are indeed foundational. Considering the role of technology in augmenting human capabilities, are there any specific data analytics or client relationship management (CRM) tools you believe could complement the consultative approach, especially in identifying nuanced client needs or patterns across engagements?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, these these tools are expanding by the day. Um, you know, for example, I've used the CRM called HubSpot and there there was a time when you were, uh, identifying potential prospect, you have to input manually lots of data about this prospect, you know, what their addresses, phone numbers, you know, uh, you know, information. With HubSpot, um, if you type in their web domain, it'll automatically populate all that information. And a lot of that is information that's useful to you in a consultative approach to go, wow. This is the customers they have. This is the business they have. This is, you know, the numbers they have. This is the growth or declining growth that they have. Um, you know, here's, uh, you know, Wall Street Journal articles, uh, you know, um, you know, the the use of of AI and a lot of these more advanced tools, I think where they really help, uh, it's not that they're better or that humans are worse. Um, I think they're better at some things and worse at others. But the key thing is how do they work together? Uh, I think that's important in the legal space. You know, with attorneys, it's, uh, you know, they tend to be a little off putting, uh, towards a lot of technology. But you have to explain to them and show them how this is a tool just like a a law book was, a typewriter, a pen, or a pencil. Uh, and they're they have to know how to use this tool in order to do their job. And, uh, you know, the\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: HubSpot's automation for data input is indeed a time-saver, especially in the initial stages of prospecting. As you've mentioned the use of AI in more advanced tools, how do you see AI being integrated into the consultative approach, perhaps in terms of analyzing client data or suggesting relevant lines of questioning based on patterns identified in the data?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: I think that's that's it right there is, uh, in the consultative approach, the more you know going in, uh, and when I say the more you know, um, there's things that you can concretely know. You know, what a company's revenues are, that's a that's a concrete number. What a company's perception is is not. So, uh, you know, I think the advantage of these tools and the way they can help in the consultative approach is they can provide you information like, you know, are their revenues stagnant? Are they growing? Are they shrinking? You know, this would be helpful, you know, when the when you're consultative approach. You'd say, I see that your business has been on a decline. This practice group, your your revenues have been falling. Um, why do you think that is? Let them tell you. You know, um, the machine, uh, learning there can help suggest the course of action. You know, um, in the actual legal work itself, uh, there's things like technology assisted review that help narrow down out of this massive information. They'll narrow down, um, documents along a certain theme. And the more that you select certain types of inputs, the more it'll deliver those inputs. So I think that's one way that it can help. But I think the key thing is, uh, the the person and the and the artificial intelligence working collaboratively, um, is greater than either one of them as an individual. And the, uh, ability to help provide factual basis to your questions that are gonna be the core of your consultation, I think, is probably the key there.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging AI to understand and interpret less concrete aspects, such as a company's trajectory, is indeed a powerful application in the consultative approach. How do you envision ensuring that the human-AI collaboration remains transparent and understandable to your team, so they can effectively incorporate AI-generated insights into their client engagements?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, I think there's a couple things I think. It has to it has to have a track record right as you use it. It needs to be solid. If the AI is giving you information that says this company is on a downward trajectory and it's on an upward trajectory that's going to cause a problem. I think just like a human being everything is always in a state of flux. It's in a state of growth and evolution and adjustments. So there might be situations where AI makes mistakes now ai doesn't make mistakes the way maybe I would of Simply being wrong, but it is subject to the the garbage in garbage or problem to a certain degree. So you is that happens? I think a process where We acknowledge that this can happen and that it doesn't AI tells us something it doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to do something on our own. I think of this process of Correction adjustment and increased learning is known and open and followed then I think you know people will work with it better just like they would a person or do the same circumstances\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have extensive experience in IT consulting across multiple geographic locations. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you managed and how you ensured stakeholder satisfaction throughout the process?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, this was in an onshore project when I was working for a client based in Illinois. I was on-site, uh, and we were taking over the project from an exiting vendor. Uh, and we had to reproduce the entire code in pseudo format because there was no history of code because they had used Agile. So we had to scale very quickly, understand the issues, document everything, and then create solo code so that the developer could start actually building the code, uh, and replace the system and actually make it workable and efficient. In addition, we also did UI UX for a digital program that they were launching, which we successfully won later on. But we had no information, and we had nobody to give us any, uh, knowledge transfer. So we had to pretty much learn everything ourselves very quickly. So it was very challenging.\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a complex situation. Given the lack of historical code and the need for rapid scaling, how did you approach the initial stakeholder management to set expectations, and what strategies did you employ to keep them informed and engaged as the project progressed?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Um, that's also a very good question. So I was the lead BA on that project. And at that point of time, we did not have the budget to scale. So I was pretty much the only BA on the ground. The first thing I did was I actually understood the scope of the project, and then I built out the plan, uh, on how this project can be executed. Then we componentized it. What I mean by that is I've broken down into pieces, uh, to understand, uh, the priority of the client because to create any kind of influence in such a situation that there's no historical information readily available, uh, we first had to create trust. So for that, we had to componentize it, break it down into pieces, uh, create an agile mindset with the client because quick turnarounds were expected, uh, and we could not and we did not know what we did not know. And we had to make that clear to the client so that we could show success while maintaining integrity, uh, and show some deliverable. So broke it down into pieces, client was traditional waterfall methodology kind of client. Uh, we brought in a more agile mindset. Uh, and then, uh, we started getting budgetary approval to start scaling a project. Uh, and that is how we started building stakeholder trust. Uh, the the client then intervened and got us some historical information from executive vendor because we went with a very clear plan of execution. So this is where we had to I had to also start project managing. Uh, I was actually traditional BA. This is where I started project managing. And then I started scaling the project. I brought in Jira, and I started actually breaking that work into pieces. And then we took the historical code and started breaking it into pieces. Uh, that is where our technical knowledge came in because that's where I had to use, uh, my technical know how and my subject matter expertise.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's impressive how you adapted to the client's needs and transitioned from a traditional to an agile approach. Given your experience with Jira, can you describe how you've used Jira to manage and track the progress of your projects, and perhaps share how you've utilized its features to communicate with your team and stakeholders?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So that is also a very good question. Uh, Jira was not very popular at the time I started it. It was known, but the client was very traditional in their mindset. Uh, so the first thing I did was I actually demoed the tool to them so they understood. Uh, I also showed them budgetary savings by using Jira because at that point of time, they were using human interface. Uh, they had used a human interface in the prior project because prior vendor had done that because of which they had no historical information. So first, I sold them the tool that this is what it will do for you. Uh, after that, what I did was because a lot of my team, especially all my developers, were sitting offshore, uh, I broke this work into pieces. I showed them how Jira works, how you can create a project, how you can create tasks, and then how you can build in, uh, test with it because I wanted them to start adopting TDD. Uh, so what I wanted them to do was make it deliverable in a way where the test proved the theory, uh, or the code, uh, so as to say. I also wanted integration because we were multi Geo. So I had people sitting in India across 2 or 3 different locations. These were my core developers. I had my management, which was my c suite sitting across America, uh, and 1 in metro Indian met in the Indian Metropolitan City. Uh, the client was on the ground over there, but they were also spread across 2 locations. So the tool unified everybody. Uh, this is at a time that people were not using Zoom because this is pre pandemic. And, uh, the it was a very traditional way of working. Everybody came to office, and we set vast meetings, which were 4, 4, 6, 6 hours. Now because I componentized everything and I broke everything down into understandable pieces, which were referenceable across time zones by everybody, Uh, slowly and steadily, that tool started scaling. Uh, as the tool started scaling, I started getting the budget to bring in more people because now I could prove that those people were actually doing work Instead of saying that this will take 10 days, I'm putting 50 developers on it. I could actually tag the developer to the Jira. So I broke it down into minute pieces. Uh, it was not done at that point of time, and I faced a significant amount of resistance. Uh, but because Jira does that, what was not known at that time was Jira was developing a dashboard, and they had a very decent dashboard at that point of time. Now there was a small cost that we lost. Like, a little bit of business was lost because we could have built that dashboard in Excel at that point of time and made some money, but we wanted to show the client value because we were building trust. There was an existing vendor. So we used the Jira dashboard. It became centralized because the client could see that we were more interested in giving them value rather than actually, um, you know, taking money out of them. Uh, we build tremendous integrity and trust with them. And then we will start we were able to put in a lot of extra work, uh, from a funding perspective because, of course, billing is everything. Uh, and we were able to bring in headcount. So while we lost a little bit of money in creating a dashboard, which was pre pre prepared or pre created by Jira for which we made no money, the fact that we introduced it to them, uh, got us a lot of trust points, and we built integrity with them. They actually liked it so much to scale it across the organization, uh, and we were able to show them how to use the tool up to a point after which, of course, once they started bringing other vendors, uh, we withdrew from there. Uh, but we were able to bring an extra headcount because they could see that we were only charging for what we were doing, uh, and we had a long term relation because of that.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've leveraged Jira effectively to not only manage the project but also to build trust and demonstrate value to your client. The use of dashboards for transparency is particularly noteworthy. Shifting focus a bit, you mentioned your experience with UI wireframing and UX digital customer experience study. Can you discuss how you've applied these skills in your projects, particularly in the insurance domain, and how they've contributed to the success of your initiatives?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Actually, this was a happy accident. Uh, I was actually at the client location, and I was, uh, able to, uh, make friends with many people. And I went for a user experience demo. Uh, at that point of time, user experience was primarily known in US. Of course, now because India is digitized, you can see those projects here also. Uh, but what they were doing was they were building something on a mobile phone, uh, for users because, uh, this client realized that they were not at the forefront of the customer's mind when it came to digital purchases, and, uh, they wanted to be there. So they had actually invited another vendor to do this. Uh, and I was, um, well, I was strategic enough to get invited to that, uh, uh, presentation. Uh, at that point of time, I saw what was happening, uh, and I understood that, uh, you know, they had different age groups of customers. A user experience survey is where you bring people of different age groups into your office. At least this is what this client used to do traditionally. Uh, and they would come in and they would be exposed, uh, to the POCs, The proof of concept that another vendor had created. And what I could see was that while they had done a tremendous amount of work on the UI, they had not thought about the UX part of it. Uh, and these are 2 very different things. So the end customer experience, uh, from the UX perspective was not very positive. But UI was very good because they were trying to bring in, uh, a UI which was diverse. So for people who can't read small print, uh, for people who are older, who may not be able to type as quickly, so on and so forth. As you have to understand, this is a slightly older project. Uh, now, of course, you can use voice, uh, but at that point, that was not an available function. Uh, so I saw the the the gap. And as you can see in my CV, I started my career in IT from a gap analysis perspective. So I'm trained to look for gaps. And what I understood was while the UI experience was very good, adoption was poor. And they were trying to understand why that was, and that was because UX experience across the board was very poor. And UX is, of course, completely different because you are looking at everything, usability, how the brand comes across, uh, what kind of trust it's communicating because you know you're using your cell phone, and your demographic may not necessarily be young. Uh, and as you can see, as the market is changing, the demographic is not necessarily investing in certain kind of insurance products, uh, but you want to pull them in. So you create a great design from a UI perspective. But your traditional customer actually can scale and purchase. You lost them because you're running after a younger customer, and you're losing your cash cow because you won the star. So I understood that, uh, and I was very lucky I understood that was because I was in the right place at the right time, very frankly speaking. And I understood that, and I was able to go back and document this, um, because I am traditionally a BA, and I could put my analysis in a quick snapshot. I could share it with my c suite management, and we were able to go and pitch that this is why you are not getting pickup from your core customer. Because while you are able to show great UI, uh, the UX experience is not good. And the customer drops in a million. Or they don't close once they've closed their transaction, they don't want to come back and use digital to buy your product, so they go somewhere else. So this is how I used UI UX, and I studied at that point of time. It was not an area where I had a lot of exposure. So I scaled at that point of time. I had to do it quickly because there were multiple vendors in the race. Um, but we were able to make a a good dent because we had displayed trust throughout our experience with them. They had a very good experience with us. They knew that we are not going to gouge them, basically. So we got that business.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your ability to identify and address the gap between UI and UX, especially in the context of diverse user needs and demographics, is quite insightful. It's clear that you've been able to pivot and apply your analytical skills to a new area, ultimately benefiting the project and the client. Given your experience with Agile methodologies, how have you integrated UI/UX considerations into your sprint planning and product backlogs to ensure that these aspects are not overlooked in the development process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: That is a very, very good question. Uh, so, yes, uh, it was very challenging because the back end developer will not necessarily marry with the front end developer, and the skills that are required, especially for UX design, are significantly different from people who are actually doing back end development. So we had to bring in that integration point. We had to buy that scale from the market, and we had to scale within our team. Uh, what we did in Jira was we actually broke out the tasks under a given, uh, you know, project in such a way that when we developed it, the end result of done, uh, if you follow business analysis and if you follow what a requirement means, the definition of a requirement delivery is the definition of done. So I define done very properly. That is the number one thing you require to deliver successfully. What is the definition of done? The definition of done was that the integration points between back end and front end had to be seamless. And the tests that we had put in, which a t shaped developer was required to do because that is where the market was going, uh, because traditional developers who have been trained in the last decade or decade and a half don't understand t shaped delivery. It is a concept which has been introduced now, But people who are in the market with 5, 8, 10, 15 years of experience have never done t shape delivery. So they did not take responsibility for doneness because that was pushed to the VA and the tester. So we had to bring that rigor into the Jira itself. So we connected the Jira to the actual delivery point so that when you are standing and cutting the branching gate and you're going to deliver it, at that point of time, once the code has run, once the production cycle is over and we are doing the postmortem of the release, at that point of time, we can only say it's done if it's actually working seamlessly. And that was brought into the Jira with different tasks, and we would not consider that task complete till you could prove through intensive testing. And you have to work together as developers because test budgets were being cut because developer. Uh, and some testing, you cannot use automation. You need manual ready tester. Because there was no budget, I did it. Uh, and we made sure we delivered. So once the client saw that there was a need for traditional testers, which were, uh, technical and UAT, we got the budget to bring in some technical testers manual testers.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've taken a comprehensive approach to ensure that the integration between front-end and back-end development is seamless, with a strong emphasis on the definition of done and the use of Jira to track these integration points. Your strategy to enforce TDD and the responsibility for testing within the development team is a key aspect of Agile practices. Given your experience with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, how do you tailor your communication to ensure that both groups understand the technical complexities and the business implications of your projects?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Up again. It's a very good question. It's a very challenging question to answer because every situation is different a lot depends on the maturity actually of your developer. See the product owner who will come from the functional side or the operational side is coming with a specific knowledge of what they want. They don't necessarily know how it will be done the Person who is coming from the technical side knows how it will be done but doesn't understand what it means for it to function and the functional world and sorry for the double function there. The thing that happens is I mentioned before developers have traditionally not been trained in the last decade or two things from a functional perspective, which is a core requirement of a t-shirt developer. So you have to bring that practice in and a lot of it depends on the resistance. You will get from the developer traditionally a business analyst is going to face that challenge because it is they are responsibility to ensure delivery is done and definition of done has been met and the technical skill that brings in is going to be the thing on which you are going to prove that. But for that your technical resource has to understand it. So there are a lot of meetings that are down in the starting where you bring the developer to the meeting on 199% of the time at least at that point of time because they are just interested in what has to be done. They look at the technical spec and they will go in building but now or at least that point of time so something I was doing and I didn't realize eventually I was eliminating BS from the market, but I would force my developers to come and sit over there. At least I used to make the lead. And eventually the guy was on the lady who was actually supposed to sit and go. I reached that point it took me over four months to achieve that level of trust within my own team that the person who's been assigned the jira. She comes to that meeting and understands the challenge. I will give you an example. We were doing a migration from ux to reach us who are kind of screen and developer was not interested in speaking to the end user or listening to the ba in this case me. And they will the screen in react and what they didn't realize was that the person who was using the Unix platform. They were actually using keyboard. They never touched their Mouse the operational guy never touches the mouse. And the developer did not consider that. And because they did not consider that extreme did not pass through in front of the client when we positioned for POC because they said well my operational user has to use about they don't use Mouse houses. They just report and what the developer had not thought of first thing. You should make it happen. Now I did this deliberately because this was a challenging situation. I had a everything in writing but to developer was not interested and I made the developers sit in that session and see the interaction. We were having they were not participating they were offering we did not expose our and put them in front of the client to show all this is the error it was not about finger pointing. So what explaining what the client was expecting? And then as we brought in agile processes, like I started bringing in the product owner I started. Bringing in that rigor that you have to understand what they are asking for. They will not know how to do it. That's where you come in you show how it's done. But they will only value what you have done is then it does what they want to do. And that's how I was able to build in the river. So initially you do some meetings. Now the market is more mature in my last assignment. It took me a little bit of time because this was this team was not used to Agile. But once they came and realized it was not about finger pointing or blaming and understanding what their actual requirement was. This is what you need to develop. They don't want to know how beautiful your code is. They want to know if they're going to get and once you understand the process, which I will explain and I will show you so let me Demo it first. So this is how I did it, but it took time it's there is no TurnKey solution over here. It depends how much are the team is there it is on the agile and how interested people are in growing and learning rather than costing.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders is quite strategic, emphasizing the importance of developer involvement in meetings and the demonstration of user interactions to drive understanding. It's also commendable how you've managed to instill a culture of learning and collaboration within your team. Given your experience with Agile and the challenges you've faced in introducing these practices, how do you measure the success of your Agile implementation, and what metrics do you typically use to track the team's progress and the project's health?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: There is only one and only one way in it, but they use agile whether you use waterfall whether you use any kind of system definition of done must be like if it is meant you are successful if it has not met no number of tools are going to help you. So the tools are there to help you achieve the objective. If you are going to put the tools in front of the objective, then your project will fail. You have to understand the mentality of the people you're working with because while I'm giving this interview in Ai, and I know the future is AI people are still traditionally working in teams and you have to make sure that they understand that definition of done is everything everything else is something which is going to help you achieve. Your objective agile is a tool it will only work if you are able to influence the mindset and for that you need money management support. But if you don't get it and you still have to deliver then you have to keep the focus of the team of definition of done and you have to show them that they have to partner with each other. All the agile tools whether it is the scrum ceremony, we teach everything and I have done training across all the global Level Training and rollouts by creating Frameworks and then customizing them to Deals. There is no one size fits all in agile and scrum also works differently. I have worked in teens where a scrum to 405 minutes which is unheard of because a scrubs ceremony should not go more than 1150 minutes. If you can keep it under 10, you will really well, but you need a level of maturity in the team, which is not as Be found because this is a practice you have to build rigor that takes time because you're changing people's mindsets. So I've used all agile tools, but we have to remember the tool is not bigger than delivery at the end of the day delivery is definition of done being night and product for the signing of product process. Yes, you have done it. That's it. But yes, you have to use the tools which are going to help you fashionable to use each other right now. It's fashionable to say you were scrum. But I've gone to scrum which are two hours long, which is nothing more than a status meeting. And then you have to change the mindset. It took me eight months to change the mindset of one particular team, which went from two hours to 17 minutes. And it was a journey. So we have to remember that every tool is valuable and you must use technology but point of using technology.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello! This is a short check to ensure that your audio is working correctly. Can you hear me clearly? Welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of questions about your resume and a case study style question to assess your technical skills. Minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to begin the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! Can you tell me more about the founding of Wave Learning Festival and the key challenges you faced in scaling it to serve over 20,000 students? \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Sure. So when I started Wave Learning Festival, it was in response to a direct need I saw in the early days of the pandemic. So the pandemic had just closed down schools across the country, and students had no summer plans. And I saw educators and parents struggling to find plans for their kids, kids struggling to continue learning and keep engaged, and being able to socialize with other people. And so WAVE started as a small project for college students to come together, do something fun, give back to the community, and organize these short seminars for kids to connect and just learn for the sake of learning all over the country. That summer ended up scaling a lot bigger than we ever expected. Over 7,000 students joined us just at the beginning. And so we saw this opportunity to bring these much needed resources to students and schools across the country, for this problem that had always existed, but only became worse during the pandemic. And so as we scaled, some of the key challenges were, a, trying to reach as many students as possible because we knew many people could benefit from our services, but how could we get the word, out to them? And so to do that, we tried a bunch of methods. In the early days, it was most word-of-mouth, but then we relied on both, we relied on reaching out to educators across the country, doing referral networks, appearing on air, which is super helpful joining groups and partnering other nonprofits, and things like that. And we were able to track the retention rates from each different source and use that to inform our future approaches.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's impressive! How did you manage the logistics of providing 700+ free, live, online, interactive courses and 7000+ hours of tutoring? \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So I think a great part of it is having a great team that breaks up old different work, and I think that's what enables any complex project. So for us, we had a variety of teams. We had an operations team that was working on all of the action actual student programming. They would interact with students instructors, volunteers, in order to coordinate all of the educational services, provide an easy experience for the students, manage communications and all of that. We had, an outreach team that would work on forming relationships with schools, educators, libraries, organizations, we could get the word out to as many people as possible, form helpful relationships, and serve schools with customized programs where needed. We had a fundraising team that was working on bringing resources to support all of our operations a social media team that would produce all the content for our online presence as well as make videos and informational content. And a tech team that would handle all of our, infrastructure and And so by breaking that up, we were able to handle the volume of students and the volume of our, services a lot better. But a lot of this is through trial and error, and so as demand for a course is scaled, we were able to see what kind of courses were working best with kids and to try to steer our instructors more in direction so that their content was directly relevant. We also provided a lot of support for instructors during their development process, for example, in helping them shape materials that were actually engaging and relevant for kids. Both correct and appropriate for the age range. And it was also from the great work of our instructors who brought so much enthusiasm, expertise in their areas, passion, and the ability to work well with peers who are just a few years younger than them. And so really, it was a great team effort, and yeah. The the the passion and wisdom of many people coming together.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a fantastic approach to managing such a large-scale operation. Can you describe your role and responsibilities as a Product Research Intern at Bubble, particularly in identifying and solving platform security issues? \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: My role at Bubble was pretty flexible, so Bubble was a smaller team, and that meant that even though my technical, role title was product research and marketing, What the the project that was given to me was to help improve Bubbles security offering. And so what I learned was that security in this context could actually take on a lot of meanings. It wasn't just about the technical security, how, you know, the data was encrypted, and secure transfer of information. But it was about this whole experience of when if a developer is using Bubble. How can they make sure, a, that they know what security actually means for their end project, are they aware of all the resources that Bubble currently provided? All the features that were available to lock down their data, and make sure the app was secure. How were collaborators being managed in an organization? And so how I started with this process was talk talking to a bunch of different bubble developers in different contexts. And hearing about what issues they had encountered. And then going into the Bubble platform and also poking around and seeing what I could see were some issues, both in the technical code base and from user experience. After talking with them, I looked at the other, providers on the in their space to see what offer what features other competitors were offering, along with industry standard practices. And then using that I identified a few different avenues of security features. And while I can't say the specifics of everything that was involved, I do remember some big buckets where what I mentioned, for example, with collaboration access and user management, with data protection, database functionality. That was a big one because a lot of these businesses were handling a large amount of data, and Bubbles database operations were lacking. Not only in, the typical security features, but even, like, data in integrity and the ability to modify large amounts of data, at once. Things like API keys being exposed, user permissions, formal verifications, and that was something that was really important for large enterprises who needed those, for legal purposes. And other things. And so after that, I built out, a plan of first, ranking which features are most important to build based on you know, how important they were to, Bubbles' business goals. The different kinds of user segments that are most concerned with each, and how that played into Bubbles' business goals, for example, business, Bubble was really looking into expand the enterprise market, so preparing for that. And then within those priorities, I outlined some plans for how we could go about building out each of these features. Taking into account which teams would be working on them, their timelines for the upcoming year, and really advocating for security as a priority that year.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a thorough and strategic approach to addressing platform security. How did you collaborate with the co-CEOs and VPs of Product, Engineering, Sales, and Marketing to implement your security proposals? \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Definitely. So the first step was after I created my proposals, I, called a meeting with these leads or my manager had called a meeting, and asked me to present to all these people. And so part of that was making sure to address each of their specific concerns underneath this overall umbrella. So for engineering, for example, the VP of engineering had concerns on how much of a priority it was to build out these new features because each one was asking for a lot of time and talent on the team when they already had lots of features competing for attention. You know, things on the product front end, different yeah. Just different ideas that they had promised to mobile users. And I really wanted to advocate that security was a huge goal because without trust in Bubble's fundamental security, we were losing lots of users because either founders didn't think that this would be a scalable approach to what they were trying to build or enterprise grade clients weren't sure that Bubble was the right partner for their professional needs and things like that. It also meant showing technical competence that I understood where the engineers are coming from and showing that these security features were, approachable within, a reasonable time frame to be prioritized. For sales and marketing, for example, that meant showing more of the human side of just how much, much of the sales they were losing because customers were leaving for different concerns and specific features that they were struggling with. Specific needs we felt weren't being met, and so what that meant for their business opportunities. And so what I did was in my plan, provide all of these different aspects together in order to bring these different stakeholders on board.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Excellent. Now, let's move on to a case study. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new online platform aimed at providing free, interactive educational resources for low-income K-12 students, similar to Wave Learning Festival. This platform needs to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly. How would you approach designing the high-level solution architecture for this platform? \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. I think it would really depend on the specifics because what you've mentioned is pretty general. For an educational platform, that's supposed to be secure. That probably applies to every EdTech platform in the market. So I'd love to hear more specifics. But without that, I think the most important, part of this approach is to be user centric. In every platform that I've seen, success or failure, especially in early days, depends so much on knowing exactly what it is that, or what your target audience is what exactly they need, and being able to provide that. And so in the Etech market specifically, I think we're so saturated with so many solutions of ideas that think people think are cool, you know, tech technology that they want to build, ways they wanna bring machine learning into education. But a lot of those ideas are unsubstantiated by a genuine need in the educational market. What are students actually responding to? What is working to help students long term? What do educators really need? And not just what is a cool technology product that we can try to convince people to use. Because those can catch people's attention in the short term, but in the long term, they never work.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood. Let's focus on the user-centric approach. What key features would you prioritize to ensure the platform is engaging and effective for K-12 students, and how would you ensure these features are secure? \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Definitely. So I think one of the key features especially for younger students, is that they need to feel a measurable sense of progress. So, a lot of online platforms do this through gamification that can come through many ways. For example, you can just have simple progress trackers where students can see how much they've been learning over time, see how much content they've already completed, and how much there is until they finish the segment. Which brings me to also breaking down content into bite sized chunks. Being able to split, you know, a lot of learning into these definable sections will help us student really feel like they're mastering 1 section at a time. And so, for example, if you are teaching a math module, it'd be great to break that into your units with individual chapters and allow a student to, be assessed at the end of every chapter with exercises or quizzes of the sort or project and be able to see, wow. Okay. So I've you know, done I've gotten a 90% on this test or I've completed project that uses skill, and that helps the student really build a sense confidence in themselves that they're really learning the material, not just looking at content passively. And this is especially important for online resources because we've seen with data that passive consumption of videos or articles is not enough to really build learning. We need to ensure engagement and really applying those skills after learning them. And so that's critical. The other thing is making sure that, the content is accessible for students with different needs. And so a lot of the times, purely video based content can struggle from this. And so, things we can do, for example, are provide a transcript of the video for students with low bandwidth or who are experiencing Internet issues. Providing, you know, exercises that are not super high resource intensive, and the third thing is having a community where students can interact. Especially if a student is getting stuck, that can be a place students really fall off the learning, learning process. So either having a place where they can interact with a real tutor or an AI tutor, for example, who can help with their questions or be able to get hints until they get the answer is super important for unblocking a student and making sure that they stay on track.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Those are valuable features to prioritize. What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in implementing these features, and how would you address them? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Definitely. I think if we're doing online content, ensuring that the content is valuable has a lot of different subcategories. So one, obviously, we want the content to be correct. Is it factual? For, you know, some stem subject base, matters? This can be easy because you can just verify that the information is you know, accurate. But for some topics like his this can get complicated as people have different perspectives on what really happened, how subjects should be taught. And so there'll be, have to have some discussion on how you represent different perspectives on these subjects, which perspectives are important to, include. And so we might want a range of different experts who can provide input on how these, materials should be conveyed to students. The second is clarity and appropriateness for the age audience. So if you're teaching, for example, US history to a 5th grader or to a 12th grader, that material is gonna look very different, both in terms of which topics you cover, the amount of depth in the subject and the way that you convey it. The third part is making sure that students stay engaged. So you want it not just be factual, but fun and engaging and really rousing the students' curiosity. Every subject is really interesting if you convey in the right way, if you make it appeal to something the student can resonate with, something that the student could see as applicable in their life, something that they can relate to. And so that is the challenge of finding and creating a good educational experience.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Great insights. What would be the key steps or milestones in implementing your proposed solution, from initial development to launch? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Sure. In terms of key milestones, first, we want to, define clearly define the user base. Then we'll want to create a plan for the kind of curriculum we want to provide, find the appropriate subject matter experts to create that material, set timelines for how much material of which, subjects we want covered. And, initially, it'll be important to limit the scope so that we can test this first. On the first product launch, it'll be important to have a small group of beta users of actual representative students as well as other subject matter experts to verify the content and for students to report their experience gathering a lot of data will be helpful to iterate on the project. And so, after a few rounds of iteration, we'll be able to launch to the public and gather more feedback that way.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Excellent. What potential trade-offs or compromises might you need to make during the implementation, and how would you handle them? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. I'm going to give a filler response for this now because I'm just testing the record platform and not really interviewing, and I wanna get this going faster.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understood. What opportunities for future enhancements or expansions do you see for this platform once it is successfully launched? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Definitely. There's a so for starters, you could add a whole range of different subject matter material. The opportunities are are endless. I mean, for a traditional, educational platform, Say Con Academy, we've seen how they started with mathematics, because it was the easiest to add exercises for. And over time, they've expanded to cover a lot of k 12 education standard subjects from history to, you know, hard sciences to literature to art and coding and all of that. So those are definitely opportunities. I think we can also venture into some nonstandard subject areas. For example, one of the great things about college education is that often you get to explore into these more niche areas where you have experts really give these fascinating areas of expertise and cutting you know, cutting edge research and bringing that students earlier on can be super valuable for initiating their passion and their interest in different subject areas. So expanding what we consider education could be super interesting. Expanding with subject matters we think are valuable to teach students. I think there's also the chance here for a more project oriented education, which we've seen piloted at a lot of charter schools to create success, where students are able to build hands on projects in different areas, work with each other to create real solutions to real problems in the world, and this can be very motivating for students.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your insights and approach. This concludes our case study discussion.

Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Give me a moment, please.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Sure, take your time. Just let me know when you're ready to begin the interview. \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. I'm ready for the interview.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've built over 100 financial models during your time at S&P Global. Can you walk me through the most complex model you've built and the specific challenges you faced with it?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So one of the most complex model that I've currently built is was of the real estate template along with the corporate financials that the client was looking to scatter and, like, research and, research in-depth about the financials and also the metrics that involves in the research, real estate, industry. The rental yield, the per square feet area, the number of the we also had included a screener in the model wherein using the Capital IQ, the user can, for, like, use the screen and get a list of all the companies and all the investment potentials that he or she can, usually visit to in finding him some deals of the properties that are currently available in in any geography or during a limited budget. So I had made that screen dynamic as well and included in the model. Along with that, I had also, like, included a key all the key financial metrics such as EBITDA, P and L, balance sheet, and, valuation, metrics, ratios, and everything so that they can analyze and and, like, help them making their decisions way better.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a comprehensive and dynamic model. When you mentioned making the screener dynamic using Capital IQ data, could you elaborate on how you ensured the data integrity and accuracy, especially considering the volume of data being processed and the potential for errors in a dynamic system?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So we do have a quality check. And also the, the screen that we build in on Capital IQ is 100% authentic data that our data teams, is sitting in the various global centers in, SMP Global Research. And, the and then after a lot of checks, they put in those data into the data feed. And, ultimately, we use that data in the form of a screener and make the dynamic using the dynamic ranges that we have in the financial models. So that, the the quality of the data is maintained and, also, it is also almost close to a 100% accurate data that we provide to the users of the financial models.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear about the rigorous data quality processes in place. Shifting focus a bit, could you discuss a specific instance where your financial analysis directly influenced a significant decision for an investment bank, and how your insights were received and acted upon?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So recently, I was working with an American multinational investment bank wherein we had connected with the associates of the investment bank wherein they wanted to scatter and find new m and a opportunities in the country of Singapore and, South Asia. So in that region, I had built a screener I had built the models. I have, like, in in -depth understood what is the requirement of the investment banks that they want, what kind of deals are they looking in. Is it, like, fully equity or, like, mix of equity and debt? And also, what's the budget? I mean, what what kind of midsize companies or, like, the small sized companies they are targeting to, and by, understanding the requirements of the, the client, I mean, the investment bank, then I'd put in all the metrics and ratios that we have available with S&P Capital IQ and also used SMP Capital IQ's estimates data so that we can, build in a a discount cash flow model so that we could also estimate the FCF free cash flow and also the enterprise values of all the companies that we're going to scatter. And through all this rigorous process and build a complex model, and they revert it to Andersen Bank, wherein they can just simply use the filters which I have provided in the model and which would automatically work in all kind of transactions, data, the datasets, and the time period that have provided would help them understand and also make decisions around the major deals that they were looking to in the region of Singapore. So that was one of the recent, and the one of the most, good project that have currently worked in the near time. Yeah.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that your work had a significant impact on the bank's decision-making process. How did you ensure the model's scalability and flexibility to handle a potentially large number of companies and transactions, especially considering the specificity of the requirements for different types of deals?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So we have used a lot of Excel, functionalities and also the Capital IQ Pro plugin functionalities that we currently have. Or may mix of both would definitely make the model more dynamic, easy to use, understand, and interpret data, and also deliver the results as per the client requirements. So I'd use offset function and other if conditions and, and we look up hlook up, and there are lot of Excel functionalities that have built into the model. Wherein, I've made also dynamic ranges for the charts. And also, the time periods which I've provided was also dynamic wherein if the if the user wants to download the data from a 1 year period, it would automatically fetch those the model dynamic and make those data available. If the client wanted to fetch around for, like, 4, 5 years data, I'd made all the lists, all the transactions, all the details of them, M and As, and everything dynamic so that the the data wouldn't, like, mismatch and, like, it would all accurately deliver according to the requirements of the client.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's evident that you've leveraged Excel and Capital IQ Pro effectively for the model's functionality. Given the dynamic nature of financial markets and the continuous updates to data and financial metrics, how do you approach model maintenance to ensure its relevance and accuracy over time, especially considering the potential for formula errors or data discrepancies as the model evolves?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: So whenever we build a model, in, capital using Capital IQ app pro, we do have a large number of teams with all kinds of various experience. Like, we have, set of other teams also in the financial model wherein they tech they take care of the technology used. And this technology has been reviewed on a quarterly basis whether the amendments are required to make the technology more better so that our dynamic models work more efficiently And, also, we also review the, all the template libraries that we have in our Capital IQ, wherein there are a set of 100 plus template libraries built on all the sets of industry, all the sets of sectors, wherein, we have each and every, data metric centric models, and these are being reviewed, updated, by all of our senior leadership and also the, the specialist in the financial modeling team. So using this approach and also the flexibility to understand the nature of the requirements, we usually amend according to the needs of the clients. So in this way, we, ensure the data discrepancy is very less and also maintain the accuracy that we usually commit to the or our clients. And that is the reason why our clients are stick to our work, and that's what I have learned in in my journey in SMP Capital, wherein, the client first approach is very necessary to run a business or to provide any sort of, models or any work that we, work alongside with global, M and A investment banks, or global firms around the world.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that there's a strong emphasis on continuous improvement and quality assurance in your process. Shifting focus a bit, could you explain a scenario where you had to use VBA to automate a complex financial model or analysis, and what specific challenges you faced with the VBA implementation?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So, usually, whenever we make a models dynamic, there is a wider utility of VBA in our models wherein, of as as we know, VBA makes our job easy. Like, in the sense that, the financial models which are included are very comprehensive, and the and the refresh of the Capital IQ is required on a segment to segment basis. So we built in VBA code in the models wherein we dissect the model into a number of parts so that each part gets refreshed gets updated, at one time so that the data, references which are made to another tabs, another sheets, or another models work efficiently. So we have used a lot of, dynamic data ranges I have also included name ranges of, the major cells that we are looking to, and then according to the filters and the parameters that I have included as per the client's requirements, I have made those certain cells and certain sections of the models dynamic and provided codes for them to refresh or to offset or to any kind of, like, like, maybe, you can just refresh it or, like, also, you can, update it accordingly. So this would make the models work efficiently. And the use case of VBA is very important. When we are doing financial modeling.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: We will now move onto the second half of the interview. This section of the interview will consist of a case study based on your present work experience. Are you ready to start? \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Can I get a moment? I only need to drink glass of water.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Of course, take your time. Just let me know when you're ready to continue. \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Yep.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great, let's get started. Imagine you are working with a mid-sized investment bank that is looking to expand its portfolio by investing in a new sector, let's say renewable energy. They have asked you to construct a financial model to evaluate the potential investment opportunities in this sector. The goal is to identify the most promising companies for investment and to forecast their financial performance over the next five years. To begin with, could you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem? \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Hi. I missed you in between. Can you please repeat the question?\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Sure, no problem. Imagine you are working with a mid-sized investment bank that is looking to expand its portfolio by investing in a new sector, specifically renewable energy. They have asked you to construct a financial model to evaluate the potential investment opportunities in this sector. The goal is to identify the most promising companies for investment and to forecast their financial performance over the next five years. To start, could you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So we can start the model by building up a list of list of all the companies that currently fall into the investment banking's the sector or the target areas. Such as if the investment bank wants to find, mid midsize firm in the renewable energy sector in a specific geography, So we can provide all this kind of parameters or the filters and build a screen, first of all. This screen would list down all the list of, potential entities that the client can further look onto. Once we get the list of all the companies, we can then start on another tab of the financial analysis wherein we can list down all the key metrics key financial ratios, and valuation methods valuation ratios and also the performance ratios along with the income statement balance sheet and cash flow. And also you leverage leverage the estimates data that we have. For all these kind of companies. Once we use the estimates, and then we bring bring that estimates back down to the current potential value using a discounted cash flow discounting the cash flows of all the future generated, profits or the cash of the companies to the current period using a cap rate and also a growth rate. Upon doing that, we get on to the terminal value of the company or the enterprise value can and then we can decide whether the investment is, feasible to look on to or not. Upon doing this, we get down the list of all the potential, industries, all the potential companies in the renewable energy sector wherein now the investment bank can, accordingly analyze given all their kind of ratios and all the the values and also the cash flow of the future of that companies, so that, the investment bank can make a decision whether to invest or to, merge that company with another company and make deals onto that. So that would be a comprehensive approach to understand and then, build upon and also list down and on for and and later on, like, build in good potential investment opportunities for investment banks. To make good, profits among all the potential deals. So yeah.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That sounds like a solid approach. Let's dive a bit deeper into some aspects of your proposed solution. What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in gathering and analyzing the financial data for these renewable energy companies? \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: One potential, like, difficulty that I can see as of now is that the renewable energy sector, the companies involved in renewable energy sector are quite constructive in data pro word in data. I mean, the companies do not provide accurate data. I mean, the data itself is not publicly available. So we need to deep dive into all the lists, all the public information available. In this scenario, we need to have a lot of research on each of the companies that we are currently looking into. Going on to their financial metric financial statements, the 10 the 10 q and 10 f, financials that they list on into the stock exchange and also get all kind of renew, resource proof, data, and then consolidate all kinds of data into and turn in and turn them into a financial model would be very difficult, but then, it it takes a lot of efforts and a lot of good research to get on to, building in such quality data into a financial model. So that would be one of the key constraints or one of the challenges that I see currently. While building up financial model in the renewable energy sector.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: That makes sense. Data availability and accuracy can indeed be a significant challenge. How would you go about mitigating this issue to ensure the reliability of your financial model? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So to ensure 100% reliability, and also to give an assurance to the client that whatever data we are gonna provide, are, like, authentic, and it's, like, useful for them to make decision decisions better and would not bluff them or, like, deviate them from their analysis part is because SNB Global, also has the data which is approved by almost all of the global associations of data centers. And data, manage database management companies, which prove it definitely proves that S&P Global, what data they are providing, is, like, almost a 100% checked and accurate to use And to and using those data, it helps our clients on a day to day basis to make their the financial decisions in a much pro better way. Also, if you if you look into a small kind of data, we do have the support of various teams wherein each and every team can, verify according to their, approaches and also get the CIQ data or on on all of the data that we provide so that, the accuracy is maintained And also, we provide the data on basis of an evidence. So the evidence of the data is also being provided to the clients to get the assurance, to do to double check and also provide the model's better.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a robust approach to ensuring data reliability. Now, considering the potential impact of successfully solving this problem, how do you think this financial model could benefit the investment bank in terms of their strategic goals and financial performance? \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: The strategic goals can be definitely, added upon if you use financial model. Because these are, like, dynamic models. Client can your use their models in and can, one single model can help them scatter and, like, screen onto a large number of industries, data on a single click. Which definitely empowers and leverages the tech power of technology and the tools that S&P Global had already provided to them which makes the data and also like, help the investment banks in making the financial decision in a much more better way.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a good point about leveraging technology for strategic decision-making. Let's talk about the implementation. What would be the key steps or milestones in developing and deploying this financial model? \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: The key steps technically begins when we have a good understanding of what the actual requirement of the client is. Whether the client is looking for, industry specific model or a generic model, wherein we provide a large number of in inputs so that client can make the dynamic models by themselves, or they are looking for us to make the model all or, like, making the the the model static so that it only caters a single kind of industry is what first we look into. And then we also after getting a good understanding of the requirement, we go go deep dive into the databases and get all kind of relevant metrics, aliases, and also the parameters which would definitely, provide the data which the investment banks are looking to. Once we build a solid robust model, with all the dynamic, parameters, and make the file dynamic. We then go run through the model along with the client and provide them a 1st draft model. Once they approve the model or make any suggestions to change or anything, modify any any aspect of one of the model, we can, again, take the model back to our name and then make those changes and deliver it again to the clients. So in this way, we, provide, models to the clients.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

Great.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've had significant experience in both quantitative finance and managing trading desks. Can you walk me through how you've balanced these two aspects in your role at CoinDcx, particularly in terms of the strategies you've implemented to manage risk while maximizing returns?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, at CoinDCX, I set up that point division and the OTC desk from scratch. Uh, the strategies that I have, uh, built, uh, were built by me along with, uh, the developer who reported to me. Uh, coming to the balancing part of it, since I was also adding the OTC desk because I do have a stable experience in discretionary trading as well. Uh, so this is where in, uh, font was leveraged, uh, there as well. So it was a pretty good balance there as well. Uh, quantitative skill set came from my internship and my work at JPMorgan in their contribution. Uh, so leveraging those, I sort of build a symbiotic relationship between OTC and, uh, Wandersk at, uh, find DCX. And, yeah, that's pretty much it. It's\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's impressive how you leveraged your experience in both discretionary trading and quantitative finance to establish the OTC desk. Can you elaborate on the specific quantitative models or tools you brought over from your time at J.P. Morgan to enhance the risk management capabilities of the OTC desk at CoinDcx?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Some of the skill set that I, uh, apart from JPMorgan were about the model building, uh, specifically around the pricing of the pricing of the things. For example, BTC, uh, does not follow a typical, uh, normal distribution or a or a black shows model. We use something called SVCJ, stochastic volatility correlated jump, to price in, uh, options on BTC. Although we didn't trade options at 0.86, but, uh, information in options were were pretty much relevant there. The other things that I sort of, you know, uh, helped other thing that helped me here at Point ECX in Quant was, uh, my experience with order books. So a lot of time because Point ECX is is a stand alone, uh, exchange in India. Uh, Indian market sort of operate differently from the rest of the world. There is some sort of, uh, premium that goes on in here. Liquidity is a bit different. So trading those, uh, liquid illiquid options and payers, uh, understanding of them sort of help me here build those strategies, uh, to sort of, you know, exploit the alpha and, uh, get the ball rolling for the team. Uh, although I say alpha and get the ball rolling for the team, most of the work eventually that we ended up building were, uh, market neutral and, uh, market making strategy rather than alpha exploiting. Given\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the non-normal distribution of BTC and the focus on market-neutral strategies, how did you adjust your model to account for this, and what were some of the key challenges you faced in implementing this non-standard modeling approach in a practical trading environment?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, issues that we faced, uh, effectively, what happened is, uh, BTC let's say, in an international market, a BTC USD or a BTC USD pair, in itself, modeling that is a bit difficult. But, uh, there are no liquidity challenges there. Uh, modeling it there is sort of like introducing a jump parameter in our modeling of, let's say, simple black shows or a, uh, stochastic, uh, black shows equation. And then maybe we can go from there. Uh, but a challenge that Indians or Indian market would face is, uh, it's built upon a upon a stable coin premium. So you have to, uh, account for that. So that that requires, uh, 2 form of understanding of things. 1 would be a stable coin premium plus the underlying, uh, underlying b t BTC issue. Now to tackle those challenges of the non normal distribution, uh, we sort of had a look at the actual BTC prices or the actual BTC auction prices that is where they are at. Uh, so compared with normal, what we have observed at BTC distribution, uh, compared to a normal or a bell curve is is is sort of, like, longer, uh, at the center, but thinner at the center, and the tails are thicker. So what it means is BTC doesn't move much, but when it does, it does, uh, jump a lot. So we just made a few changes in our strategies accounting for that. Uh, one example would be that, let's say, when I'm trading, uh, for market meeting, and if the spreads are normally in a in in in a very stable or a mature market, the spreads change basis volatility when our market making would would largely follow some form of normal distribution. But at Bitcoin, the spreads, uh, versus volatility, uh, at a very low volatility, we could keep, uh, spreads lower and make money. But as soon as, uh, volatility increased slightly, the spread that we adjusted for were pretty high. So this is an explanation for the thing, uh, for the change in the normal distribution of Bitcoin, uh, versus a traditional asset wherein, you know, the the the the tails are thicker and the centerpiece is thinner and longer. Your\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your detailed explanation highlights the complexities of modeling and trading BTC, especially in the context of market dynamics and liquidity variations. How did you quantify and manage the stablecoin premium and its impact on trading strategies, given its significant influence on certain pairs?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, we have a pair called USDT INR, Tether INR, which is, uh, the most liquid in Indian markets. Uh, what we had come to realize is the the stable coins premium with, let's say, a dollar INR, uh, value is is is function of, uh, three things, basically. 1 would be your regulatory enrollment. So whenever there is some form of, like, regulatory uncertainty or people who want to exit, uh, crypto market in general, uh, that premium sort of shrinks. The other would be, uh, whenever, uh, there is demand to buy BTC in India relative when I say demand to buy, relative to the rest of the world. For example, there may be a selling pressure in the, uh, rest of the world, but let's say the selling pressure or the selling volume or the selling intensity is Indian low. In that case, that premium would expand because it makes sense for people to actually buy USDT and then use that USDT to sort of, like, buy, uh, BTC. So that premium is sort of like a vote on India's propensity to hold, uh, crypto in general versus the rest of the world. Uh, and adjusting for some form of regulatory and the friction in moving, uh, money around. So let's let me give an example. Let's just say the regulatory and the friction. Like, uh, INR is one way convertible currency. Uh, that, uh, regulatory friction and the other thing, let's say, it account for 2 and a half percent premium. Anything more than 2 and a half percent in my model or in my trading, I would attribute it to the India India population's propensity to hold cryptocurrencies in general. So that sort of, like, is the word on that. Uh, one of the example is whenever there were regular regulatory uncertainties in India about banning crypto or, uh, stuff like that, uh, a year or 2 back, uh, this this actually premium turned into a discount. It traded below the INR, uh, USDT market. So there are qualitative aspects and quantitative aspect both in managing that premium of stablecoin. Under\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the factors influencing the stablecoin premium in the INR market is crucial for effective trading strategy. How do you approach the integration of qualitative and quantitative factors into your models or trading decisions, especially in situations where qualitative aspects may not have clear numerical representations?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, this is wherein, uh, we had, uh, we took help from Offshik. This is wherein, uh, they we they they, with the health analytics, had built some form of scraping from Twitter and other things. And, uh, we adjusted our parameter based on those, uh, feedbacks. But everything qualitative, uh, whenever we cannot quantify we could not quantify it, uh, had to be sort of, you know, tinkled with parameters manually. Whenever we could quantify it, for example, if the premium is going down, uh, we know that, you know, the demand, uh, for BTC, uh, in India is, uh, compared to the rest of the world, is slightly less. We can, uh, sometimes, uh, you know, uh, go short on a BTC thing. If if premium is expanding pretty aggressively, we could go long on BTC because everyone is going long. But a lot of those qualitative factor, which cannot be quantified since you asked about non quantifiable qualitative factor, I had a whole, uh, team of traders. Uh, think of those traders as a sell side bank test wherein they run their OTC desk. So we had inventory and warehousing of things, and those qualitative factors were taken care by my team from that part of the team. So I had 2 teams. 1 who was doing solely quantitative stuff. The other were discretionary trader, uh, who sort of would take care of, uh, qualitative aspect for the team.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Integrating sentiment analysis from sources like Twitter is innovative for adjusting trading parameters. How do you ensure the reliability and accuracy of these qualitative inputs, especially when they're used to adjust trading strategies significantly?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, we didn't use we didn't we didn't rely on Twitter significantly, uh, specifically for, let's say, our mainstream points. Uh, whenever there was now to make sure that, you know, the the the sentiment analysis or, uh, whatever we are doing, why Twitter is not giving up on, What we did is, uh, we sort of looked at the real world signal as well. For example, when there was, uh, BTC, ETF news, there were a lot of preemptive sentiment, uh, on on Twitter, which had to be checked with other, uh, mainstream news sources as well. So once our Twitter thing, uh, is there, if we we didn't go all in on the trade, we just, uh, were sort of, like, cautious and, you know, maybe initiate a little bit of trade and be, uh, be ready to, you know, get a bit, uh, higher quantity trading in in in in the market. But once as soon as the news is, uh, sort of, like, confirmed by one thing or the other, uh, we sort of, uh, jumped into a trade. So Twitter was just one of our parameter. Uh, sentiment from website scraping and other thing is just one of one of one of the parameter. Then have very large weight. Uh, it become important around certain, uh, turning point in the market. This was not always relevant. For example, when there's a huge sell off, uh, when, uh, when there is a very large open interest, let's say, around, uh, option expiry or even there is when the funding rate between futures and BTC, uh, b BTC spot is pretty high. In that case, we we felt that, you know, uh, this could be relevant. Under normal circumstances, that didn't play much into our trading. Given\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of qualitative factors in your trading strategy, how do you envision leveraging AI or machine learning models to better incorporate and perhaps even automate the adjustment process based on qualitative inputs?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Input that option he needs to do. Uh, I think it's pretty easily, uh, uh, can be pretty easily handled by, uh, by an AI model. For example, a lot of scraping that is done is simply a code, uh, which can be scrapped. This is that, uh, an AI model can simply, uh, sort of, you know, uh, have some form of qualitative score score, something like a greed or a fear index that we have for equity market. That sort of index can be built by an AI model, which obviously can be refined as, you know, uh, it gets trained over more data, uh, to to figure that out. How that reacts, how that greed and, uh, fear index once we have derived that greed and fear mix via AI, how that is leveraged, uh, with the actual actions in the market. For example, when the market is pretty much, uh, to the greed side, and let's say, uh, how how are the jumps looking? So in that case, my assumption this is how we did it qualitatively was every downward down should move down jumps were pretty, uh, aggressive and swift, but the up moves were, uh, sort of, like, drifting in nature. So that sort of thing with AI can pretty easily be done. I think, uh, the whole qualitative aspect of things current pretty much, uh, the level that we were doing can pretty much be automated by an by an AI. The only place I think human, uh, touch would be required is via the experience or, uh, the parameters of the area that AI is not looking at. Because, uh, as I said previously, there are times when one factors are, uh, you know, very important as compared to the other. So PB and AI would probably take time on training, shifting from one driver to the other driver. That's the only challenge AI would face with regard to, uh, qualitative factors. So AI plus sort of like an human observer, uh, is pretty much, uh, something that can be replaced whatever we were doing with, uh, our strategies. Consider\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Considering the potential for AI to handle qualitative aspects, how do you plan to ensure the interpretability and transparency of these AI models, especially in an industry like finance where understanding the \"why\" behind a decision is crucial for trust and risk management?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Start, uh, one one way to build trust, uh, especially in in an in a Fintech or a finance sector would be to have an, uh, human observation. Maybe you can, uh, over a period of time. The second thing is backtesting the AI itself, like, which, uh, which are the turning points. Just like any other program or any other coding, uh, things, I think there are gonna be tail cases. Uh, identifying those tail cases could be pretty important. Again, uh, this is very in a very large set of data, at testing things, where the things are going haywire, uh, can come into the picture. We can add a layer of, uh, permission, uh, if AI based decisions are there. For example, not going beyond, uh, certain things, and we can have a strict stop loss. So my point is we already have, uh, CTAs or algorithmic trading, right, uh, built into the system. And AI is sort of, like, expanding that domain with lot of qualitative factors, uh, maybe quantifying them into, uh, an, let's say, a greed or fear index or some form of rankings, uh, to sort of, uh, enhance those. So just like our, uh, algorithmic trading or height, uh, high frequency trading has happened, has evolved over a period of time, it doesn't always make money. Sometimes there is a need for a human observer to make sure the risks are, uh, managed correctly. But, uh, AI greatly enhances, uh, the abilities of that human observer wherein, you know, the datas are readily available, uh, to be to be seen, like, what's the exposure and, uh, the other things. How do you\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you envision the role of AI in dynamic risk management systems, especially in terms of its ability to identify and respond to emerging risks in near real-time?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Be really interesting. Like, a lot of risk management that happens are rule based in in financial firms and other places. For example, when your leverage goes beyond these things and, you know, like, focusing on sudden risk, for example, currently, I would say, uh, Israeli run risk. I think a lot of equity managers would be or crypto managers would be paying attention to. These are all, uh, I mean, pretty much, uh, lot of things that are done by human can be done by AI. And lot of decision makings, which are simply rule based. Uh, lot of those decision makings are if then else in nature. For example, this is the risk. We calculate bar and we say that, hey. We need to reduce the risk. And then this is where in in AI, which, let's say, our trading program can come into picture and opportunistically can reduce the position. Keep an eye for the hedges if so a lot of, uh, these things at at least at at older or, you know, of of of of traditional houses that happens, most of it are if then else, uh, system monitored by a human being. So that is, I'm guessing, pretty much easily automatable, uh, by by an AI. The benefit with AI as compared to a traditional coding would be, uh, the longer it can run, the longer the better it can get trained, uh, which probably was not there with the traditional, uh, coding or something like a conditional, uh, coding, uh, previously. As\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: As AI systems learn and adapt, how do you propose to manage the potential for AI to develop unexpected behaviors or strategies that may not align with the intended risk management goals, especially in complex and interconnected financial markets?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So for example, this is not a new problem, to be very fair. Uh, this problem, I think when we started, uh, I think when I say we, when humans started, uh, with the algorithm trading, this was there with algorithm trading as well. How do we manage, uh, the sizes of the position, the leverage, or the the adverse, uh, potential of losses? And this is wherein we we came up with a rule based system. We came up with, uh, systems wherein, you know, limiting the AI in certain cases. So I think those conditions can automatically be in built. Uh, I don't see it different than a human trading. For example, when a trader a human trader is taking position, there are certain limits on it. You cannot go beyond this risk. You cannot take this many positions. Uh, the net position or the net d v zero one or sensitivity or whatever drivers cannot be higher than this one. This can be sort of, like, uh, implemented within AI system as well. The other thing is at least till the time AI is training, we can have, uh, 2 order of, uh, sort of, like, uh, lock locking mechanism wherein, you know, once, uh, if something goes on in the first order, the second, uh, code or a second form of a technology can take care that, you know, the systems are, uh, working properly as in, you know, uh, the strategy stops there itself. We have in I've got in trading as well today. Uh, let's say if your losses go beyond a certain limit, the the strategy, squares off everything, stops for a while, sends a notification to a a trader or a manager, sending them, he takes the further decision. So lot of, uh, the problem that, uh, we we discussed are, uh, sort of existing for a volume trading as well and, uh, taking care of there as well. How do you\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you plan to ensure that the AI systems remain transparent and auditable, especially in the context of regulatory requirements and the need for stakeholders to understand and trust the decisions made by these systems?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: System or, uh, like, decision making system, the logs for the same should come in handy. Today so this is equivalent to, uh, SCC regulation for, you know, banks to to have those communication happening through community challenge so that when whenever that happens, those, uh, communication can be audited that were sort of, you know, useful, uh, especially in things like lab or stand alone, nothing. Same way a lock of actions of, uh, of AI decisions can be maintained, uh, wherein a lock can have the action and the reason for the action. And then let's say a size of the trade and, uh, stop loss and take profit for the for for all the things. And, uh, that logs can be updated, uh, with the decision. For example, you had a trade and the logs should be updated, like, why did you took, uh, take profit? Why did you change something? What are the relevant details that has happened? So, uh, a log can have, uh, sort of, like, a water flow model wherein, uh, one scale would be sort of like the summary, the list of the trades, and other thing. You can click on that rate to see, like, what were the basic detail. And then just like a blockchain, it can have other details, like, uh, during the life cycle of trade, what what all things had happened. And, uh, if there are losses, like, uh, one one can have another look, what could have been done well, and, uh, what would, uh, ideal situation would have demanded, when should have the book losses. So, uh, sort of like a equal into a blockchain ledger, you can have a decision making ledger for a for an AI, for regulatory requirement, and for the transparency.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: View? Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on outlier detection at Expedia Group. Can you tell me about a specific challenge you faced while working on this project and how you overcame it?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So this project is regarding productionization of, uh, uh, outlet detection. So it's like an application which, uh, can have any input and it's a unit, uh, outlet detection algorithm and we have to specify that, uh, uh, this type of algorithm we need to apply for getting the outlier. Like, a simple sense, we can use, um, k deviation from the mean or we can use a profit model. So these are the the 2 algorithms which is generally used right now. And, uh, my work was to productionize it and, uh, also a creative feedback loop around it. So this feedback loop means, like, uh, our system will run on a daily level. It will be a a spark job. Uh, it will run daily. It will test the data. It will run the proper model on each of those features, and it will store the results, uh, to some of the circuit. And, uh, it will if an outlier is directed and it will log the data in the DynamoDB table for quick access, then a feedback will be sent to the Slack channel. Now from Slack channel, uh, human in the loop like data scientist or data analyst, they have to manually check whether the data point was really an outlier or not. So it's a human feedback which is also getting captured. And, uh, from Slack, like, they need to click on that confirm button, which cause a Lambda job. And that Lambda job updo updates the particular records entry and then a more difficult table that for this entry, like, the human in the loop has also detected also detected it as an outlier. And that, uh, thing is being used for the next stage outlet reduction. So creating this feedback loop was a challenge. Um, it was an infrastructure challenge or engineering challenge, I would say.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you had to implement a robust feedback loop system to improve the outlier detection process. Given that you mentioned using the Prophet model, could you elaborate on how you integrated this model into your system and what kind of performance metrics you used to evaluate its effectiveness?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, it's not like, uh, we are like, uh, basically, we are using proper to detect the outlet data points. It's like it takes, uh, the last 30 days of data as a training data point, and we have said the para hyper hyper parameters for the profit model that is some default parameters. And let's say, today's or later, see this data point will be considered for the inference part. And, uh, with the help of training the training period, we'll get the minimum bound and maximum bound, and we will check for the latest 3 days whether it is inside the bound or not. If it is not, then the system has to throw in out has to detect that point was later as an outlier. I have to send the relevant notifications. So we are not evaluating any model over here. And, yeah, like, the ML scientists, when they were doing the analysis or experimentations at that time, they figured out that these are the optimal parameters for the profit model. Right. Yes. That's all.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, you've implemented a straightforward monitoring system using the Prophet model's bounds for outlier detection. Shifting gears a bit, I noticed you've also worked with BERT for NLP transaction categorization at Oracle. Can you discuss how you fine-tuned BERT for your specific use case and what kind of improvements you observed in the model's performance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so over here, like, uh, we were not fine tuning the bot model for our use case. So it's like, uh, it was like categorizing the transaction relations. So we created the embeddings of transaction categories. Like, we created 100 categories embeddings, and we saw it, you can say. And, uh, whenever a new transaction comes, we do the filtering of the text. And we say we'll see we do all the preprocessing of the textual information from the translation region, and we give a sentence. So we create the embeddings of that sentence using same BART model. And we use call center to figure out that which of these categories are most resembling to our narration. Uh, so basically, we use bot to create the embeddings of, uh, our input narration and all the categories data which we have with us. And DocuSign similarity to this give out the most matching categories.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a clever approach, using BERT for embedding generation and cosine similarity for matching to transaction categories. Can you tell me more about the pre-processing steps you took for the transaction narrations, and how you ensured the quality of the embeddings for such a diverse set of data?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. Uh, so it's like, uh, it's like a bank transaction statement. So from there, what we do is, like, we have to remove the numerical information and also, like, uh, any extra symbols which are not relevant in that particular narration. And after that, we get, uh, like, a a clean sentence. Like, it might be, let's say, Zomato hyphen I and hyphen some number, something like that. So we have figure out Zomato out of it. Uh, so it was, like, uh, some rule based approach. We had a set of rules which based on that, we were filtering the text. And let's say we have to figure out, like, uh, if we get any like, any matching category out of our set of categories. But if we don't get any matching category, uh, with the help of what then what we used like, we have kept a threshold, and the cosensibility score should be above 0.7. If it does not, then what this our system was used to do is, like, um, our process narration will be sent to the Google search API. So, like, the Zoom item, it will be sent to the Google to understand the contextual information of I mean, understand the meaning of this word or this set of words. So, like, uh, Google will say that, like, this is, uh, for delivery platform chain and so on. So it will give a sentence. So we, like, we extend that sentence from the Google search API's result, and we were feeding the embeddings of that sentence and then again comparing with, um, other set of, uh, transaction categories using BERT and cosine similarity.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you've put a lot of thought into the pre-processing and fallback mechanisms for cases where the initial embedding matching threshold wasn't met. Using a rule-based approach for text filtering and a third-party API for context extraction is quite innovative. Given the complexity of financial data and the potential for sensitive information, how did you handle data privacy and security concerns, especially when integrating with external services like the Google app search API?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. Uh, so, basically, we're filtering, uh, all the relevant information I mean, all the confidential information from that narration. Like, if, let's say, it's a bank cash withdrawal term. So the sentence which was going to the search will only have the words of the narration. And the total narration translation narration is having at least 25 to 30 character length. And when we remove the relevant characters out of it, like, we hardly get a 10, 15 character length information, and, uh, like, uh, those information was not any confidential information.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a prudent approach to maintaining data privacy by ensuring that only non-sensitive information is used for external searches. For the remaining part of the narration, where sensitive information might still be present, how did you ensure compliance with data protection regulations, and what measures did you take to secure the data within your own systems?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: I didn't click like, uh, over here, we were having that kind of issues because, like, the final data which we were giving, uh, to the API, to the Google search API, it was having the sentences or words. It was having the set words. So you can say 2, 3 words in 1 narration. And those words are you can say they are related to some, uh, restaurant name or some it will be some shop name or some restaurant name, basically. So that information is already in the public domain. So we were not having the issues of, uh, predicting the data and data security.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, it sounds like you were able to leverage the public nature of certain data elements to avoid privacy concerns when using the Google search API. Given your experience with machine learning models and the various tools and frameworks you've worked with, can you describe your approach to model versioning and deployment, particularly in the context of the projects you've worked on at Expedia Group and Oracle Financial Services Software?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Uh, can you explain the question once again?\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Certainly. I'm interested in learning about how you managed the different versions of machine learning models during your projects at Expedia Group and Oracle Financial Services Software. Could you explain the process you followed for tracking and deploying new versions of your models, and how you ensured that the deployment process was smooth and reliable?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so I will explain about Expedia. So we have a model registry service system. And what happens is, like, uh, when we train our model, uh, like, we have 3 different environments. 1 is a Databricks environment in which ML scientists do the R and D work. And, uh, I'm I'm an ML engineer. My role is to take the, uh, system build by ML scientist and make production as it and maintain it and track it as well. Uh, so we have a model is the service in which, um, you can store a model or you can store any object file inside it. Uh, and a version tag is assigned, and you can give a set of tags along with your version file. So it's like in the back end, it is storing the data in some s three bucket, and it is maintaining a dictionary. Okay. Now when it comes to deployment part, uh, we deploy we create a docker image of the application, and we in that application itself, there will be the code and the ML model. We fetch the ML mod we have a GitHub Actions workflow, which fetches the model from MRS, create a docker image of our entire code, which has the model artifact in it as well. Then this docker image is, again, registered on MRS, uh, model history service. Like, um, we'll just start basically a Docker image over there. Like, this is Docker image for this particular application, and it gives a relevant version to it. And then we deploy it, uh, with help of model internal model deployment service tool. It is build it's like we deploy dockers with the help of Kubernetes, uh, on AWS easy to instances. Then, uh, we have to specify, like, let's say it's a live inference service. So how many parts we have to give or, like, how we have to monitor, like, what will will be the scaling policy? And, uh, you can say, like, what will be the time out policy? So we dip we define all those envelops configurations when we are deploying with the help of Kubernetes. And in terms of monitoring, like, um, let's say, for live inference service, so we monitor, uh, latency request failure. So for that and a lot of different parameters, like, which all you see 2 instances are having are working for this, uh, application and how much is the error rate or the success rate for each of those EC two instances, uh, whether a port is failing or whether the port is scaling when the number of request increases or decreases. At the time of testing, we do load testing as well to figure out whether our model will handle a huge amount of traffic or not. Alright. And, uh, so to create this monitoring system, we make use of data log to log other metrics over there.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive explanation of your model versioning and deployment process, highlighting the use of a model registry for version control and the integration of CI/CD practices with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services. The emphasis on MLOps configurations for deployment is also key for maintaining performance and reliability. Given your experience with monitoring, can you discuss how you've used tools like DataDog to monitor the performance of your machine learning models in production, and perhaps share an example of how you've identified and addressed a performance issue based on the metrics you were tracking?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Alright. Uh, so let's say, like, uh, it's a live inference service. So we track, uh, um, the accuracy rate of no. Not not accuracy. I will say, like, uh, the latency rate, like, how fast our request is being solved by the model. Then we check, uh, and the request comes in the real time and the response initial will return. So it's like, uh, we use a fast API app to build it. And, like, uh, we monitor a number of requests which is being fed to the model per second, then, uh, number of ports which is running right now. What is the memory consumption in the port, what is the CPU consumption in the port, uh, whether it is increasing over the threshold, like, so it's and we basically monitor the error rate and the tree latency threshold. Like we said, in this in one of our project, we have said the latency is 300 milliseconds. So if it goes above so it means, like, the number of ports are less for us or the number of port configuration is, uh, I mean, the instance type of the port is, um, not supporting our application. So we have to increase the instance type. I mean, have a better machine. And also to increase, we have to increase support to support the latency. And regarding the error rate, we have to, like we have we store all those logs on Splunk. So, like, uh, we have to fig I have to check the logs to figure out, like, why some of the requests are failing, what is the underlying reason behind it. In one case, it was, like, uh, the client team was having a time out of one second. Like, they will send the request, and they need the response in just one second from the model. But in my model itself, like, um, we are calling a dynamo DB service to fetch, uh, uh, features to like, in DynamoDB, we used to store the features for live and friends. So to fetch those features from DynamoDB, it we had a time of of one second from there as well. So it's like, uh, the client team has set a time out to one second, but our services also set a time out to one second. So if some features are not available on DynamoDB, so it gives the error after one second is over. And by the time we throw the error, you know, to the client team that, uh, for this specific, we were not having the feature. The client has all already disconnected the connection, and we were getting a zero error. So this was one channel which I figured out, and we monitored the time out of from the client team. We because it took a second and so that our system was able to give relevant response, uh, and it was 1.5 second. Then comes, like, uh, another thing of monitoring called model drift. So it's like, uh, there's 1 batch of inference application in which we check, like, whether our models like, we train that, um, we do the inference for this batch inference model at every weekly level. So in every week's output, we check the model drift with the help of population statistic index, a PSI to figure out whether the current set of, uh, result has been different from what was there in the previous, uh, at the time of training of the model. If it does they they they differed a lot in the PSI indexes, um, greater than what I will say 1. So it means, like, there's a model drive time. It's a time to retrain the model. So this is how we do other monitoring.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: You've provided a detailed account of how you use FastAPI for building services, and the specific metrics you monitor, such as latency, error rates, and resource utilization. Your experience with identifying and addressing performance issues, including client-side timeouts and model drift, is crucial for maintaining a high-quality production environment. Given your experience with model drift, can you explain the strategies or tools you've used to retrain your models in response to drift detection, and how you've automated this retraining process to ensure minimal downtime for your services?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. Uh, so it's like, uh, there are 2 cases of retraining. It's like, uh, one case is that figure out that, uh, the the value is less. But, again, like, uh, in Nextiva, we cannot retrain them. There's one thing, like, we if we want to retrain, then we will set up a feature that, um, the retraining should it should be a live retraining model. Like, the retraining should happen every weekly level. So that is one case. 2nd case is, like, um, if you want to retrain the model, then it's, like, uh, then assigned to set to sit down, figure out, like, what was was the issue with the previous model. And to roll out a new model, then we have to release a proper UAT first, then release a proper AB testing first for a 1 month or 6 week of time period. And, uh, we track, like, uh, whether the new model is performing better than the previous model or not. If they testing results are conclusive, then we roll out to the new version of the model. Now for the rolling out, it's like, uh, we deploy the next version of of our docker image, uh, with the new new model by our model deployment service on Kubernetes. And it's, like, once a new service is like, during the AB testing service, like, the new service will be serving 50% traffic and the old service will be serving the less less 50% traffic. Now when we roll out that 100% traffic to the new to the variant group in the AB testing, so it means, like, uh, the ports will scale out for the variant group. And once it is in all the ports for the variant group, uh, has been allocated, then the request will be sent to the variant group. Once, uh, the request has been successfully sent to the variant group, then for the control group, uh, the ports will start decommissioning because it is not receiving any request. And this is how we roll out to the next version of the model.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to model retraining and deployment is well-structured, emphasizing the importance of live retraining and thorough testing through UAT and AB testing phases. The gradual rollout strategy using traffic splitting is a best practice for minimizing risk during deployment. Can you elaborate on how you measure the success of the new model during the AB testing phase, and what specific metrics you look at to determine whether the new model is ready to be fully deployed?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Alright. Uh, so there are a lot of more metrics, I will say. And, uh, those metrics, like, uh, there's a data science team. Uh, you can send data analytics team who does, um, this part of work. And it it's like they track one thing I can say is, like, uh, I was working on one ranking system. So let's say a new model gives the rank. So we check, uh, the numb what are the number of clicks which has been made on the suggested rank and the number of conversions or number of bookings. Uh, so you can call us these are the rates which we monitor them. We check another thing. Like, we have given a set of rankings, but whether the user have clicked from those set of ranking or whether they have changed to some other set of ranking or whether they have made any other kind of searches. If they made any other kind of searches, it means that our ranking was not relevant to them. That is why they made some other kind of search. So this is another rate, uh, which we monitor, which we evaluate, basically. And based on all these scores, uh, the data scientist team, like, uh, they make the solution that whether it is a good conclusive result or not.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Monitoring user engagement metrics like click-through rates, conversions, and bookings is indeed critical for evaluating the performance of a ranking system. It's good to hear that your data science and analytics teams are involved in making these assessments. In addition to user engagement, do you also consider any operational metrics, such as system resource utilization or error rates, to ensure that the new model is not only performing well for users but also maintaining system stability and reliability?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: It's like we monitor the port configurations as well. Like how much is the CPU utilization and the memory utilization and as I told like we monitor the latency which is given by the new model and if like in one of the case of a testing the new model was build on XD boost distributed XP boost and the previous model was it was also based on xbos, but it was not a distributed examples. So for the new model like the effect size was more and it was the intense time was more for the new model. So we had to increase the pods number of Parts number of kubernetes parts to support this new model. So it's like when we are rolling out the new before we roll out the new model. We do a lot of testing. To figure out that how the models were performed when the real traffic is being introduced also like before testing. I'm after we done the Lotus testing like lot testing is on our own set of data points. We use Lucas to do that. And after that before starting the testing we sent a shadow traffic 50% Shadow traffic to our model is well for one week time frame. So that helps us to say that in the real traffic is being here, whether our engineering infrastructure can handle that request or not or how much are related to swing and how much is the latency in that one week of time since we set the optimal kubernetes Sports configurations, and after that they be testing starts.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', \"Interviewee: Yes, John. I'm ready. Great.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in data analytics and predictive modeling. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you worked on at Amazon and how you applied machine learning to solve the problem?  \\n', 'Interviewee: For asking. Is the challenging project one? It was, um, it is confidential project. However, I will give you an overview of it. So it is basis on the real time analysis. So what happens, a video comes from a data stream, and, uh, we have to do some analytics on it that how much video flow is in the stream and how much workforce we need for it. So it is, uh, like the real time analysis. So what we do, we put it into the, uh, firehomes and then apply the Lambda function to check what is the current flow of the video streams. And we also, uh, in Lambda function, we also provide the input to do the trim for the videos for the sensor that, uh, it occupies less space. And, uh, the adequate amount the proper amount of video or the video stream goes to the associate or whoever is processing it. That was very challenging and we have to use Amazon Data Fire Tools, Amazon SageMaker in that, uh, we use Pandas and NumPy. And, uh, we also use 2 phase information using, uh, seaborne heat maps or correlations like that. It sounds\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you've had hands-on experience with real-time data processing and AWS services. Given your use of Amazon SageMaker, can you elaborate on how you utilized SageMaker in this project, particularly in terms of model development and deployment? And could you also explain how you integrated the machine learning models with the real-time data stream?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, actually, we were working as a a machine learning engineer, and there's a different team for the development. So what happens, we process the input for it and fed it into the data streams via Amazon SageMaker. So what happens there, uh, we just, uh, give the input data to the data stream. It just goes through the, uh, Amazon data files, uh, files, where whether it is Amazon Redshift or is it in s 3. And it does the data mining from there. And, uh, that is also the test data. So what happens in the test data, they do not provide us the real data in the first instance. We have to use the test data for that. So we just, um, for example, if it is, uh, real time analysis, so what happens there, we face the data and, uh, put it into the Amazon SageMaker using, uh, the Panda stream. So whatever, it is cyclic learn. And, uh, from there, we import the SVM, sport vector machine, and, um, do the modeling from there. And sometimes we also leverage the AI model like CNN RNNs. It's clear.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you've had a collaborative role in the machine learning process, focusing on data preprocessing and model integration. Since you mentioned using SVM, could you discuss how you approached feature selection and engineering for your models? Also, I'm interested in how you evaluated the performance of your models in the context of real-time data, and what metrics were most important for your use case.  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Thanks for asking. So in terms of, uh, SVM, support vector machine, we, uh, primarily use PC, principal component analysis. So it penalizes the features which are are mostly related or it has high correlation with each other. So they just, uh, trimmed out those features. Features. And sometimes we also manually check whether, uh, some important data is not missing from there or PCA, uh, had PCA done the exact analysis for it. And regarding the matrices, mostly it was precision and recall. So, for example, we had to feed out false negative values from that mostly. And first, for uh, regarding cost, was it if they went into the suite, that is going to be put in as the icon for the job. And regarding the, uh, first negatives, it should not be there because we cannot miss out the important data from not being visualized by the associate or not being, um, I mean, the same process by the associate. Using\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using PCA for feature selection is a solid approach, and it's good to hear that you were mindful of feature correlation and missing data. Precision and recall are indeed critical for a classification problem like the one you described. Can you tell me about a specific instance where you had to balance precision and recall, and how you made the decision to favor one over the other in your model tuning? Additionally, how did you handle the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability, especially in a real-time system?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: That is a good challenging question. So regarding, uh, since we are talking about, uh, Amazon guidances, so I'm going with that thing only. So what happened there? Uh, the beta was up 2 types. Uh, they were up the 2 types. 1 was high confidence, and another was low confidence. High confidence means machine learning, uh, already answered by itself. However, regarding the low confidence, it was not confident to them to answer. So what happened there, uh, when we classified the these jobs into LC or HC, LC by means, uh, low confidence, HC means high confidence. And, uh, for example, in the PC, we are talking about PC. In case it did not provide it, uh, educate input. For example, an easy job was marked as l c or an l c, important job. It was parked as, uh, like, false negative. So in those cases, we missed out the important data. So I had to go through it whether it is working pro uh, we just took the little little sample from the data and checked whether it is working fine or not. So it used to come around 90 to 95%. So we were good with it. Because, uh, important data is there, then we can consider it. And, uh, regarding the trade off between these two, so what happened, uh, mainly because some of the trimmed videos right there or empty videos right there, there was nothing going on in the videos that was the noise. We consider that as noise or trade off. So we usually used to fetch the data and check the little samples if something is there. If, uh, it was there, then we need to check the code or the machine since, uh, in Amazon, you do not need to code again and again. So you can understand it is all the tools running in the behind. You just have to test the data and do a little ETA or ETA and ETL, sorry, extract transform and load. And, uh, it is a little buzz, but, uh, regarding the more hands on coding in Amazon, uh, we do not take that out, uh, on the last scale, but first, uh, little little step we used to employ it. Balance\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Balancing high and low confidence predictions is crucial, especially in a system where human intervention might be required for low confidence cases. Your approach to sampling and evaluating the model's performance is commendable. Given the complexity of the models you've worked with, how did you ensure that your models remained interpretable, especially when presenting your findings to stakeholders who may not have a technical background? And could you also touch on how you communicated the potential risks of model predictions, such as false negatives, to these stakeholders?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: John, so regularly, since I was in the team, we were the team of 5 data engineers, and there were also many teams working in the behind. So I can talk about my team at Hippo too. So I worked under the data scientist. Uh, he was very experienced, and he had a large of a large amount of experience there. So regarding the false negative, since, uh, most as you told, you are very right. Most of the stakeholders, they don't have any technical knowledge what we were talking about. Right? Like, this is what we call our first negatives, first positives. So we have to tool them, uh, make them understand that, uh, look, uh, since, uh, during the data processing for example, if we use human for all the data, whether it is HCLC or anything, Uh, it will cost you millions because you have to employ a large number of people, and they should be well versed with the knowledge, but they'll see what is HCLC or to answer. So, uh, we want to make them understand, uh, how AI is helping us out in it. And we just, uh, provided a thought put for them. They're like, uh, what is a false positive? And what's a false negative? We told them that false positives, for example, if something is there and we tell that it is not there, it is a false negative, and we are already ignoring it. So that means we are missing an important input. So we are losing on data and it may not be accurate. So we have to be careful about the false negatives. Regarding the first positives, if it is there, for example, as something was there and we told that it is not there. Uh, sorry. It is there. But if it was it if it was not there and we told that if it is there, it is a false positive case. And it is okay if it goes for the processing. But the the things which, uh, for example, in if in a beta, nothing is there. Considering with nothing is there. So and we tell them that something is there. That makes a problem because we are, uh, wasting the time of the associate who is working on the system in the background. And, uh, similarly, it was easy for them to understand what we were telling, and it was very communicable for them also. It's great.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you and your team were able to effectively communicate the implications of model predictions to stakeholders. Making the AI's role in decision-making clear and using relatable examples like the cost of human labor versus AI solutions is a smart approach. Given your experience with AWS, can you discuss a time when you had to optimize a machine learning model for better performance or cost efficiency on the cloud? What specific AWS services or strategies did you employ to achieve this?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Here's John regarding my challenging project or when I had the optimize them already existing project. It was mining the data from Amazon redshift. So what happens there initially when the data is reprocess it you may know that it goes into S3. Then as separate coffee command. Command is given and it goes to the Amazon ratio. So at some point, I don't know whether it was a glitch or not. I faced the data from density, but I found that and I think two features that they were not being processed it. I don't know why but you know them they considered that it is good. Finally doesn't need any optimization. So I will make you understand since it is a confidential project. I will tell you how it so whatever working on a data and we found that Associates who processed the data in very low time. They used to get it's a high confidence jobs, so it should not be like that because since you have a group of Associates working in the background station get that equal amount of time. They answer the queries or the videos, which they have been provided. So I found that and I implemented the classification like K nearest neighbors and then made the groups and using the paid plots. I found this and all the and I then informed the same to the stakeholders and my team manager and they took the decision accordingly and then after that. we just took all the I mean whatever features were there, we considered all of them and only few of them were then drop on the list and process it\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's interesting to hear how you identified and addressed the issue of unequal workload distribution among associates by implementing a classification model. Using KNN and pair plots for feature selection is a practical approach. When you say you considered all the features and then dropped some, how did you determine which features to drop? Also, how did you ensure that the model you implemented was both accurate and fair in its distribution of work among the associates?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: It's John. Uh, since it is a confidential project, I will not go in-depth in it. But, uh, two features right there. As I already told you, the associates were getting for those who answered in the less time, they were getting easy easy workflow, and it was not very complex for them. And, uh, using that, they were in the top of their metrics because no one knew in the background, uh, using the these things that since they answered or, uh, processed the job in low time, they were getting less jobs. So we just fine tuned our Amazon client That's the real time. It was all, uh, real time data analysis there. So we had to fine tune it, and we just, uh, made sure that, uh, the lambda function is working correctly and, uh, using the input like shards and how they would deface the data from our stream. And, uh, it went uniformly, uh, to all of the associates. I under\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: I understand the sensitivity of the project details. Focusing on the technical aspects, it's clear that you leveraged AWS services to ensure fair distribution of work. When you were working with Lambda functions and real-time data, how did you handle the monitoring and logging of these functions to ensure they were performing as expected? And in terms of model validation, what techniques did you use to test the fairness and accuracy of the workload distribution model you implemented?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes, John. Uh, I forgot to answer this in the previous question. I missed it out. Sorry for that. So regarding the, uh, fairness of this model, we just checked the f one score. And, uh, we also sometimes, uh, went to the model score using, uh, like, we take the model score from scikit learn. Because we for example, if we cross the data, there's a very large amount of data. We just took some little sample from it and then, uh, used the model score or Apple score for it. From then, we did the null hypothesis also. That is also a way of doing it, whether it is funding in the path or not. So regarding the Lambda function inside the Amazon Kinases, so, um, it was already predefined there. We have to do little change. Like, we have to adjust the time. And, uh, sometimes we used to, uh, go through the loops. For example, we, uh, use the conditional of our conditional modeling there and give it a function like, uh, while, uh, the associate answers this job, and then it should go again there, and it should be uniformed. The same job should not go there. And, like, uh, it was like first come, first serve reason. Like, easy jobs who are processing the jobs in little time. He's getting all the easy jobs and getting the admin addresses, and that was not fair like that. No problem.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: No problem, and thank you for clarifying. Using the F1 score and model scoring from scikit-learn are good measures for assessing model performance. It's also reassuring to hear that you considered the null hypothesis to ensure the model's predictions were statistically significant. For the Lambda functions, it's clear you had to tailor them to meet the specific needs of workload distribution. Can you elaborate on how you implemented the conditional logic within the Lambda functions to ensure fair distribution, and what kind of testing or simulation you performed to validate that the new logic was working as intended?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: John, uh, when we reported this anomaly to our, uh, I'm reporting to the manager and he reported to them as stakeholders or whoever was in the background he, uh, reporting to. So, uh, but in the testing mode, uh, we'll just place the data. And, uh, in the Amazon guide system, the Lambda function, we adjust the time flow. Like, uh, when we assign a pair to our that associates were getting the easy job flow. We're answering it in the little time. So we had to adjust that because it was just going 1st come, 1st serve basis. Whoever is answering and the little time is getting the easy ones. So we just made a distribution there, like, uh, using the central limit theorem. For example, if it is not a good distribution there, if it is not uh, symmetrical distribution, we use the, uh, central limit in the normal cases. Why, uh, however, in there, we use the while while loops there. For example, while the associate is answering the job in the less time, we should still get the, uh, same complexity, complexity, uh, as the other ones are getting. And once we implemented that in the, uh, Firehouse Amazon Kinetic, we just took this, uh, little data from there and checked ourselves whether it is working fine or not. So similarly, we went on with model score. If it was 95% and above since it was very easy, it should be 95% and above. So we just implemented it like that. Implementing\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Implementing a fair distribution system using the central limit theorem and while loops within the Lambda functions is a clever solution to ensure equal workload complexity for associates. It's also good to hear that you performed manual checks to validate the system's performance. Given the complexity of this task, how did you ensure that the system remained scalable and efficient as the workload increased? And what kind of automated testing or monitoring did you put in place to catch any regressions in the workload distribution?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: John, regarding the complete, uh, complexity and the regression thing which you're asking, how we have monitored that? So first of all, I will go with the distributions. So I will make you understand, uh, the job flow was same. It was not different. So for example, if there are a 100 jobs in the queue, consider the video as jobs. I'm telling that, uh, there were 100 jobs in the queue. So what was getting, uh, if what was happening if there is a set a and a set b, Uh, if associate a answers the job in the less time, uh, so I repeated it many times, you will get the easy one. So when I use the Lambda function, what happens, they are the same under jobs by uniformly distributed. For example, if, uh, an, uh, a machine predicts an LC and it is very, uh, critical. Uh, for example, if there are a 100 LCs and the the total job flow is 200 jobs, so it will divide 50 ML 1 and 50 50 ML, other associate. So regarding the fairness of this, uh, in background, we employed the k nearest neighbors and we checked, um, this thing whether if it is going uniformly across all the associates or not. So groups right there, and we face the data from the clusters. It's cleared.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed among associates. Using KNN for clustering and ensuring that the system remains scalable is a good approach. To further understand the scalability of your solution, could you discuss how you handled the dynamic nature of the workload? For instance, how did your system adapt to sudden spikes in the number of jobs in the queue, and what measures did you put in place to ensure that the system could handle an increasing number of associates or jobs without significant performance degradation?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes, John, that was a very good question because I have faced this values. So what happens I already told you it is regarding the videos which were loading in the background Associates have to answer them or the process them. So sometimes the workflow increase at your rightly mentioned. So in those cases, we always have a backup Associates because the same number of SSS can also work on this data, but we cannot delete or drop some data from the input so that there is a loss to the company or whatever we are working there is lost to the crosses. So we have a backup amount of associated with in the different processes, but they were trained on this process all so in case there is a sentence Spike we used to get the input from the key and and which is already there. He that processes that can and there is also Amazon quicksight quicksight Q. Basically we use it that also showed that there is a number of backlog or we are missing out this number of data or slee and accordingly if we need more Associates, we took the associates and they were the hands on the system. However, sometimes what happens the jobs were processing being repeatedly, so that was one concern. It happens sometimes ridiculous or something.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: The interview? Yes. Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your background. I see you've worked on ML solutions for healthcare. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while developing ML models for healthcare, and how you addressed them?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so I have built various, uh, uh, ML models in health my health care domain. So our client was basically from US, Boring and Ingram. So our, uh, our main objective was to do market with more modeling auto categorization and also, you know, IMDM, uh, trigger. And, also, I have done few project and product performance. So, uh, based on, uh, market mix modeling, I have done using linear regression random forest and also, but random for us was not, uh, very efficient to our condition because market mix modeling was to queue on the, uh, the revenue are ROI and also effectiveness and contribution to to the client. So we the client didn't want anything, uh, anything complicated, so we stick with linear regression. And, also, uh, in auto categorization, I have used a bot algorithm for NLP, uh, and the product performance, it was just a automation project.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Interesting approach with the use of linear regression for Market Mix Modeling. How did you determine the model's adequacy for the given data, especially in terms of capturing non-linear relationships or interactions between variables? And for the NLP-based categorization using BERT, what were the key considerations in fine-tuning the model for your specific use case?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, in the in the in market mix modeling, we use linear regression because, uh, our the data we had is, like, kind of, uh, so we after clearing the data, we found that there were a really relationship between independent and dependent variable. So we wanted to stick with linear regression. So, uh, so we we went with the linear regression itself. But after that, we tried to digit and lasso, uh, to fine tune the model, but we couldn't do that. Uh, the client asked, like, he didn't want any, um, bias variance to put in the model. So we stick with the base model. And, again, after that, we just, uh, consider the, uh, linear regression as our final model using adjacent r square adjacent r square and r square has our primary evolution metric. And for NLP, we used both clicks. I wasn't a complete part of that project because I was in the from the middle of the project. I got so the data was clean when I got introduced into model. So since I had some knowledge in the NLP, I I started exploring various models. So, uh, when we started, uh, like, introducing various other NLP models like ALSDM and BERT, but BERT gave, uh, good accuracy, uh, in in terms of, uh, precision and recall and also accuracy. So we still do it, the board model for auto calculation.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to model evaluation, focusing on bias-variance tradeoff and the use of adjusted R-squared as the primary metric for the linear regression model, is quite insightful. Regarding the NLP model, even though you joined the project midway, your exploration of different models like LSTM is notable. How did you manage the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, especially considering the potential resource-intensive nature of deep learning models like LSTM?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, when I got introduced that our categorization was that, uh, like, there were tickets. Like, we have to auto categorize based on that. Uh, so we had discussion with client on how to, uh, go through the accuracy and other stuff. So when when he, uh, like, when what was your question again? One second. Can you ask me?\\n'], ['Interviewer: Certainly. I was inquiring about how you managed the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in the context of the NLP model for ticket categorization. Given the discussions with the client on accuracy requirements, how did you ensure the chosen model (in your case, BERT or other NLP models) was both sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient for real-time or near-real-time categorization of tickets?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, like, we the do you to do the artificial medical category, we we use like, we had product like offer for a b a, and we we had to do it quarterly wise. Uh, so while doing that bias variance trade off, like we found that um, bird was giving more efficiency when compared to we just explored more various models. We didn't go through uh, insert the model the with the bias radius video. But when we got to, like, it it reduced, uh, we, uh, BERT reduced almost 95 percentage of the manual work which was put in there. So we tried to implement bot itself as our final model.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Implementing BERT for ticket categorization and achieving a 95% reduction in manual work is a significant accomplishment. Shifting focus a bit, I see you've worked with PySpark for ML. Can you discuss a specific instance where you had to optimize a machine learning pipeline in PySpark, and the techniques you used to improve its performance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Py PySpark, I personally haven't implemented in my, uh, client project because they were only using Python. Py, uh, PySpark, I have used as my learning, and, also, I have, like, just, uh, did a small, uh, project in my of my own, uh, like, of my own because because interest. I haven't, uh, deployed any model, uh, in, uh, PySpark using YAML, uh, but I know a few kinds of YAML flow, which is used in, uh, where where we can automatically, like, uh, put in all the, uh, data, and we can get the required output, uh, till deployment.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding your experience with PySpark as more of a learning and personal project tool is still valuable. Leveraging MLflow for model management and deployment in PySpark is indeed a relevant point. How do you envision incorporating PySpark into your client projects in the future, especially considering its potential for handling large-scale data and distributed computing for ML tasks?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So, yeah, uh, we have already, uh, we have already a discussion going on to introduce Databricks into our client environment or VDI because, uh, there, we we don't have to put put in manual effect to face the data from SQL and then, again, uh, claim the data using Python and put in other m one models by ourselves. So, uh, we have asked our client to, like, if if there, uh, like since we did this auto criteriation, it was not a huge amount of data. But we have the discussions are going on when in our client is are going to allow or like the database. Uh, we'll be trying to, uh, build our, uh, model in the memo flow from PySpark itself. So we have go have having discussion with our clients. So once they agree, uh, if the data is too large and it, uh, Python can't can't handle the data, We'll be trying to include PySpark as well in our client BDA.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Introducing Databricks into your client environment for handling larger datasets and complex workflows is a strategic move. As you engage in these discussions with clients about adopting Databricks and potentially PySpark for their projects, what are the key considerations you keep in mind regarding data security, scalability, and the learning curve for your team in adopting these new technologies?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So,\\n'], ['Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a pause in your response. Could you please continue with your thoughts on the key considerations for data security, scalability, and team learning curve as you plan to adopt Databricks and PySpark for client projects?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So Databricks, we can, uh, we have in encryption access control network security, data masking, uh, audit logging, and data loss prevention authentication, and also data governance. Uh, so a regular security audit, uh, we we approach this, uh, this all all this 9 or 8 things to our client Um, based on our, like, since, uh, we we concluded that it is a high security, uh, like it has high security for our data. They were our boss can't, uh, convinced with our thing. Um, so by this, uh, by by this, uh, by this financial layer, maybe we build we'll be trying to bring data breaks into our client environment. So we explained that all, like, the data governance, like, established data governance and produces, uh, ensure compliance and, uh, regulation standards. So, also, like, data security, uh, will like, we can have security audits and other assessment assessment also. So authentication, we can use, uh, like, strong authentication, uh, like, uh, a multi factor authentication or single on authentication. So we approached our client based on this, uh, uh, all these things. Yeah.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your detailed approach to data security and governance with Databricks is commendable. As you focus on ensuring compliance, security audits, and strong authentication methods, how do you plan to maintain the balance between robust security measures and the ease of use for your team, ensuring that security protocols don't overly hinder the development and deployment processes?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So yeah. Uh, like, since, uh, because, uh, data breaks even the data, like, uh, we have robust security or data security. We can use the data whenever we want. Uh, like, once it is deployed, we can easily, uh, take the data and we can use it for development. So I think there will be no challenge such challenge in the development if we bring data security or governance, uh, into our consideration. But, uh, yeah, we'll have to, uh, work on with the clients so the video sometimes, like, video will be slow. So we don't want to, uh, like, what's like, like, we don't wanna, uh, lose some time some somewhere or lost some time, uh, bit because of this issue. So we'll be working, uh, like, if the video is fast, we'll be able to, um, you know, do the development and other stuff so easily without any time constraint. Uh, that's what I'm thinking.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Ensuring that the robust security measures in Databricks don't significantly slow down the development and deployment processes is a valid concern. How do you plan to proactively address potential performance impacts that might arise due to enhanced security measures or governance protocols?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so, uh, can you come again? Sorry.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Certainly. How do you intend to proactively address any potential performance impacts that could arise from the implementation of stringent security measures or governance protocols within your Databricks environment?  \\n', 'Interviewee: '], ['Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a pause in your response. Could you please share your thoughts on addressing potential performance impacts in a secure Databricks environment?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, like, we can, uh, use, uh, resource optimization, uh, like, uh, since we have optimized use of computer resource, like, we can keep with everything in a cluster or a auto scaling process. So we don't have any high security level and also so a storage efficiency will, like, implement data life cycle, uh, policy to manage data retention and detection. And also clusters scheduling. Like, uh, we can use clusters to run our data. So, like, we database uses clusters. So the data, like, we, uh, will be having good amount of, uh, time to develop any process on energy sufficient infrastructure infrastructure. So, like, cloud tools, region, and data center with energy efficient infrastructure and, uh, other energy like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud offer. So also monitoring on optimization, we can, like, monitor the the the uses of the data and build in multi tools, like third party solution or that. Training and awareness awareness, we can provide training and, like, um, we can provide, uh, training and raise among other users among our colleagues and, like, to to keep an environment impact on our workload also. Green data analytics explore opportunities to use, uh, Databricks or green data, uh, green data analytics, uh, in set you such as, uh, analyzing environment data, optimizing, uh, energy usage or supporting. Uh, by this, uh, we can, like, uh, Yeah. We can, uh, we we will be efficient with the database coming into our client's video.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Leveraging resource optimization, such as cluster management and data lifecycle policies, is a proactive approach to maintaining performance efficiency in a secure Databricks environment. How do you plan to ensure that the training and awareness programs for your team regarding security and governance practices are comprehensive and effectively implemented?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, what's that? Training? Can you come again?\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you envision designing and implementing training programs to ensure that your team is well-equipped to handle the security and governance features of Databricks effectively in their day-to-day development and deployment activities?  \\n', \"Interviewee: K. So, uh, to ensure our training, uh, like, try any we can, uh, like, uh, training program. We can design program by training program design, develop a comprehensive training program, and, uh, tailor the different roles and what, uh, like, can include some hands on exercise tutorials and rule based training, uh, customized training materials or other different within your organization, include data engineer, data scientist analyst, focus on, uh, the specific tool as well. And our onboarding process, like, provide user with the structured onboarding process that introduce them to Databricks, uh, fundamentals, uh, um, platform architecture, best practice and guidelines, offer mentorship, something like that. Uh, training delivery, like, uh, offer, um, training session in a variety of format include, uh, instructor led, uh, some classes, self paced online course, webinar, shop shop workshops, and documentation are also hands on practice. This is the best among all, like, Increased hands on proudly, we're providing access to a sandbox environment or, uh, any training, uh, cluster, uh, you you user can use within the data, uh, database certification program. Like, if we bring certification program, people will, like, uh, involve a very a very a very constantly or, like, in a good manner, and, uh, like, um, we can exam we can, uh, we have we can give exam to validate the Databricks users proficiency, also feedback and the evolution, uh, evaluation and, like, continuous learning, uh, maybe also community engagement. These are the things, like, I feel, uh, it will be a good approach to use Databricks in our client environment as as yet.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Designing a comprehensive training program that includes hands-on exercises, role-based training, and customized materials for different teams is a solid approach. How do you plan to incorporate feedback from your team and integrate continuous learning into the training program to ensure that it remains relevant and effective over time?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, feedback and, uh, training, uh, like, we can we can keep on, uh, upgrading whatever the the whatever development as new thing coming up in the data bridge. So we can keep on, upgrading the program has has we, uh, has we as the data base getting improvement, uh, in in the in the in the course which we provide, on that basis, I I guess we can, uh, like, take a a feedback in the sense, like, if we are giving some exams or, um, exams are like something else. Uh, exams are like, uh, we can use feedback mechanism like in, uh, blink and feedback mechanism such as surveys, suggestion box, or regular meetings together, uh, input users also, uh, and encourage to provide feedback in various aspect of data breaks including, um, usability, performance, and features. Also, training evaluation training, uh, evaluate effectiveness of the training programs through assessment, uh, quizzes, or survey, uh, to measure more knowledge. Uh, so collect feedback from the trainees about the quality of the training material, instructor effectiveness, and the relevance of the topics. Use, uh, training evaluation results to identify the areas of improvement and make sure adjustment has, uh, a program training program and continuous improvement. Early continuous, as I told in the first one, come continuous, uh, iterate or improve training materials, curriculum, and deliver method based on the feedback from the user. Incorporate new features like practice, best practice, and industry, uh, training, uh, into trends into training program to keep user up to the date with latest advancement in data, uh, data breaks also. Trailer training, like, offer personalized data. Like, if if the person if our user is a data engineer, we allow for data engineer specific course to that guy. And if he's a data scientist or ML engineer, we'll be offering, uh, ML based, uh, ML based program to that, uh, user feedback integration also, uh, like user feedback in the product development process by collaborating with the, uh, with the Databricks support team or submitting feedback. Uh, these are my steps to, um, improve training and evaluation in our Databricks.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Incorporating feedback mechanisms such as surveys, suggestion boxes, and regular meetings to gather input from users is a proactive way to ensure continuous improvement in your training program.

Document name as well as in the document, and reverse index will be created previous, uh, reverse index will be automatically created before the query is fired. And, uh, open search will give you the result. So most likely, these are word is used for, uh, used multiple times in the particular document, and it will index reversely. So the document which has maximum number of pizza keyword will be given first, and then 2nd and 3rd and 4th. So intuitive search was our use case, and that is, uh, that is what precisely I implemented. I used OpenSearch tool. And in OpenSearch tool, I used KNN version for the reverse indexing.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Using OpenSearch with KNN for reverse indexing is a clever choice for intuitive search applications. How did you go about training and updating the KNN model to ensure it remained effective as new documents were added, and what was the typical response time for a search query from the ML model microservice?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Model microservice used to give response within fuse, uh, few within a second only. 1 or 2 seconds, I do not remember the correct number right now. But and this the point about retraining the model was, like, we used to retrain all the model again. Because KNN is not, uh, not an algorithm which can add up, uh, add up again. Right? So retraining was a major challenge we were facing at that time. But we used that pipeline, like, whenever the recall, uh, recall was the metrics which we used to measure. And if recall is less than 80 percentage, we used to retrain the whole, uh, uh, whole model.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Achieving a response time within a few seconds for the ML model microservice is quite impressive, especially considering the need for real-time suggestions. Shifting focus to your data engineering work, you mentioned improving data pipeline response times by 2x for the ML model auto-fill suggestions. Could you describe the architecture of the data pipeline before and after your optimizations, and specifically, the technologies or techniques you used to achieve this significant improvement in response time?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. So they were so there is a Crunchbase database. They used to prepopulate before. So whenever a company is onboarded, they have to fill a big form. So so in our comp, uh, in Pronto, in our team, we already created one pipeline. So, basically, it takes company name. It searches into Crunchbase database, and then again give the output. So what I did, I cached, uh, I used BigQuery, first of all. So I used event event driven architecture for that. So as soon as the company starts to fill onboarded form, it will go into, uh, so the cloud function will be called in GCP, and the that cloud Cloud Function will search into BigQuery. And then, uh, if the because Cloud Function and BigQuery are highly, uh, tightly coupled services. So the response time is really low. So, uh, as soon as the as soon as the database gives the output, we used to print that the application level. So so, previously, they used to store in the Postgres database, and it was deployed in the Kubernetes Kubernetes node. So that is how because so many nodes were involved, there was delay in the response. But I gave them suggest I gave our team lead a suggestion to use BigQuery. So cloud function, BigQuery, and, uh, again, a cloud function to give the response of yeah. That is how I implement it.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Transitioning to an event-driven architecture with BigQuery for real-time data processing is a significant architectural change. How did you manage data consistency and reliability in this new setup, especially considering the shift from a traditional database like Postgres to a more scalable solution like BigQuery?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Correct. So data consistency we used to We have set up a Cron job. We set up a crown job and that Cron job will would work like a crawler web crawler and which will go which if every four or three hours would go to Crunch based database and update all the necessary information about the company. So crunchbase would update the update its database every now and then so that is why we set up one Cron job to prepopulate our bigquery tables and and that bigquery would be updated each every three and three to four hours and that is how data consistency. Okay, so that is how data freshness is maintained. So as far as data consistency is as far as data consistency is concerned bigquery is a highly reliable service and which is a serverless architecture. So data consistency was not an issue because we used to create Two tables one is primary table and another one is secondary table. So if Primary table does not give response. For some reason we used to store that table we used to we used to use that secondary table as well as we have also implemented backup strategy in place. So all the tables for automatically get stored in in our GCS. A Google storage cloud and that is how data consistency we used to keep up to the mark and reliable. So both the services are reliable. Cloud services with uptime of 99.99 SLA. So that was not our major concern.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Setting up a web crawler as a Cron job to update BigQuery tables from Crunchbase is a clever way to ensure data freshness. Given your experience with both AWS and GCP, could you compare their respective services for data engineering and machine learning, and discuss scenarios where you might prefer one over the other?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Ah, okay. So for the I mainly used Google bigquery in my previous organization, which was static analytics. So AWS is service is received which is which they have given as a data warehouse solution. So in bigquery, the corresponding AWS service is redshift. So GCS bucket. The corresponding service is AWS bucket like S3 bucket Cloud functions at the Earth signatures execution functions, which would run around 15 to 20 minutes in gcp. The corresponding service is Lambda functions in the AWS. So kubernetes service are equally in at the both Cloud platforms like gcp they have eks and AWS also they have case elastic Cloud elastic kubernetes service or something like that. Additionally AWS provides many other services. So in gcp they have one service called Data proc, which is a managed service, right? So in AWS, there is something a like is ears k or something like that in gcp I have also worked with AI platform service. So we just basically used to train automatic model and deploy the models here. They have one service called sagemaker. So sagemaker is able to train models as well as deploy them and creating pipelines over the cloud the apart from that I have also used container repository. So in AWS, they have ECR elastic container repository and gcp container registry or something like that. So yes, so there is the head to head comparison of from gcp to AWS.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Your comparison between GCP and AWS services for data engineering and machine learning is quite detailed and insightful. Given the complexity of managing AI models in production, what strategies have you found effective for monitoring model performance and ensuring timely retraining to avoid model drift?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So there was one tool which I which we used for, uh, like, uh, it is called Dataiku. But if we keep aside the Dataiku, so, uh, we can use monitoring services like, uh, Cloud Monitoring in AWS. We can u we can calculate the recall or whatever model metrics we are using. Like, there are multiple model matrices, like recall accuracy. Correct? Uh, so there are multiple. So if we are calculating recall, so we need to measure the recall at each interval. Right? And if that recall is reduced let's say we have set up the benchmark around 80 percentage. If recall is reduced from the 80 percentage, then, automatically, we can set up the retraining pipeline. Correct? So retraining pipeline would take some training data from BigQuery or something like that. Then, uh, it will, uh, create, uh, it will automatically start virtual machine. Then, uh, automatically, we if we have set up Jupyter Notebook by Jupyter Notebook, then it will start executing that Jupyter Notebook and retrain the model. Then we can store that model into, uh, bucket or something like that because, uh, GCP provides that, uh, provides that service that we can store our pickle file of that machine learning model in the GCS. And GCS can be exposed as an API. So that thing can be done automatically. And if, again, the recall is, uh, less than 80 percentage, then, again, we can trigger the retraining pipeline. We all I I have also explored cube flow for that matter, because cube flow is, uh, used, uh, is an open source tool, and which is also which can be also used to, uh, create a a machine learning pipelines. Right? And apart from that, there are many other services. In GCV, they have call stack flow, uh, uh, so which can which can, uh, be used to monitor the logs, as well as which can be used to trigger the emails or notifications. In AWS, uh, we have cloud monitoring and the cloud emails or something like that. I'm not able to recall that service, but this provision can be provided. Like, emails can be triggered to notify stakeholders that our machine learning models recall or accuracy has reduced significantly or something like that.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Leveraging tools like Dataiku for model monitoring and management is a solid approach. How do you ensure the security of AI models and the data they operate on, especially when exposing models via APIs?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. Sure. So, yeah, that is an interesting question. So security, generally, we have used cloud security only because all the time, we have, uh, all the all on each time in my career, I have deployed models in the GCS or the corresponding service, and which are any which they help which they give generally, uh, good security. For example, in GCP, you cannot log in without G Suite. Correct? API, all the APIs are secured with secret passwords. So it was not our major concern. But apart from that, we have also ensured that if, uh, if someone tries to, uh, do a d d o s attack, like distributed denial of service attack or something like that, we implemented API gateway in that place. So API throttling, um, so there are multiple approaches, like API throttling or, um, all the things can be done. So in a so in one architecture, we have provided API gateway, and then that API, like Cloud function, can then be called internally to our machine learning model. So our model is not directly exposed, because first layer of defense is there there only. And internally, we can call cloud function 2, machine learning model, CPI, and something like that. So that will reside in the VPC only. So no so only one IP, sir, IP is exposed. And, uh, apart from that, nothing nothing else is exposed. So that is how we ensure the security using some techniques like throttling and others other stuff.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Implementing API Gateway with throttling rules is a strong security measure to prevent unauthorized access and DDoS attacks. How do you approach the interpretability and explainability of AI models, especially in industries where regulatory compliance and transparency are crucial?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So that is again an, uh, interesting question. So I I haven't really thought about that. But explainability is something like, uh, keeping names simple. Right? So, uh, all the, uh, input and outputs are sorted. So so models should be ex easily interpretable from the humans as well. So that is the approach they take, but I haven't worked much apart I haven't thought, uh, much about it, because I was not a full fledged ML engineer. I was performing a role of data engineer with back end engineering skills. So yeah.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Focusing on model simplicity and human interpretability is indeed a foundational step toward explainable AI. As you continue to grow in your AI and data roles, exploring techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) could further enhance the explainability of your models. How do you see the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, and backend engineering evolving in the context of AI-driven applications?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Right. So the major thing is that if model is ready and if model is more if if machine learning or data scientists have created a model which is useful to the business case. So then backend less deta Engineers less. Ml Engineers rule comes into the picture. So the integration of that model into our application the smoothness correct though without bug and extensible model. So generally we take micro Services approach so that our model can be all the necessary things can be performed with them with that model but ensuring that integration reliability consistency. That is the major role of backends less data engineer so creating. Creating data pipelines which are which ensures the necessary updated data is available to over data scientist in timely manner, which is the first task second task is that model can be integrated with the application smoothly third task is if something is required like monitoring pipe monitoring the models or deploying them or triggering pipelines or something like that that can be achieved smooth seamlessly. So these are the intersections where backend Engineers less data engineer can be useful and choosing the right database service for storing the data and creating data pipelines. For example, not each and every time we can use bigquery if the solid use case is there like we really need that data for analytics or feature engineering then only we wish I generally prefer to take bigquery approach otherwise data can decide at GCI GCS like storage bucket because storage bucket is really cheap. So it is not a manager is it is a blob storage so Yeah, so this isn't about database from approach like backend code. And so that is where back endless datang engineered really people.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have extensive experience in IT consulting across multiple geographic locations. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you managed and how you ensured stakeholder satisfaction throughout the process?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, this was in an onshore project when I was working for a client based in Illinois. I was on-site, uh, and we were taking over the project from an exiting vendor. Uh, and we had to reproduce the entire code in pseudo format because there was no history of code because they had used Agile. So we had to scale very quickly, understand the issues, document everything, and then create solo code so that the developer could start actually building the code, uh, and replace the system and actually make it workable and efficient. In addition, we also did UI UX for a digital program that they were launching, which we successfully won later on. But we had no information, and we had nobody to give us any, uh, knowledge transfer. So we had to pretty much learn everything ourselves very quickly. So it was very challenging.\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a complex situation. Given the lack of historical code and the need for rapid scaling, how did you approach the initial stakeholder management to set expectations, and what strategies did you employ to keep them informed and engaged as the project progressed?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Um, that's also a very good question. So I was the lead BA on that project. And at that point of time, we did not have the budget to scale. So I was pretty much the only BA on the ground. The first thing I did was I actually understood the scope of the project, and then I built out the plan, uh, on how this project can be executed. Then we componentized it. What I mean by that is I've broken down into pieces, uh, to understand, uh, the priority of the client because to create any kind of influence in such a situation that there's no historical information readily available, uh, we first had to create trust. So for that, we had to componentize it, break it down into pieces, uh, create an agile mindset with the client because quick turnarounds were expected, uh, and we could not and we did not know what we did not know. And we had to make that clear to the client so that we could show success while maintaining integrity, uh, and show some deliverable. So broke it down into pieces, client was traditional waterfall methodology kind of client. Uh, we brought in a more agile mindset. Uh, and then, uh, we started getting budgetary approval to start scaling a project. Uh, and that is how we started building stakeholder trust. Uh, the the client then intervened and got us some historical information from executive vendor because we went with a very clear plan of execution. So this is where we had to I had to also start project managing. Uh, I was actually traditional BA. This is where I started project managing. And then I started scaling the project. I brought in Jira, and I started actually breaking that work into pieces. And then we took the historical code and started breaking it into pieces. Uh, that is where our technical knowledge came in because that's where I had to use, uh, my technical know how and my subject matter expertise.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's impressive how you adapted to the client's needs and transitioned from a traditional to an agile approach. Given your experience with Jira, can you describe how you've used Jira to manage and track the progress of your projects, and perhaps share how you've utilized its features to communicate with your team and stakeholders?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So that is also a very good question. Uh, Jira was not very popular at the time I started it. It was known, but the client was very traditional in their mindset. Uh, so the first thing I did was I actually demoed the tool to them so they understood. Uh, I also showed them budgetary savings by using Jira because at that point of time, they were using human interface. Uh, they had used a human interface in the prior project because prior vendor had done that because of which they had no historical information. So first, I sold them the tool that this is what it will do for you. Uh, after that, what I did was because a lot of my team, especially all my developers, were sitting offshore, uh, I broke this work into pieces. I showed them how Jira works, how you can create a project, how you can create tasks, and then how you can build in, uh, test with it because I wanted them to start adopting TDD. Uh, so what I wanted them to do was make it deliverable in a way where the test proved the theory, uh, or the code, uh, so as to say. I also wanted integration because we were multi Geo. So I had people sitting in India across 2 or 3 different locations. These were my core developers. I had my management, which was my c suite sitting across America, uh, and 1 in metro Indian met in the Indian Metropolitan City. Uh, the client was on the ground over there, but they were also spread across 2 locations. So the tool unified everybody. Uh, this is at a time that people were not using Zoom because this is pre pandemic. And, uh, the it was a very traditional way of working. Everybody came to office, and we set vast meetings, which were 4, 4, 6, 6 hours. Now because I componentized everything and I broke everything down into understandable pieces, which were referenceable across time zones by everybody, Uh, slowly and steadily, that tool started scaling. Uh, as the tool started scaling, I started getting the budget to bring in more people because now I could prove that those people were actually doing work Instead of saying that this will take 10 days, I'm putting 50 developers on it. I could actually tag the developer to the Jira. So I broke it down into minute pieces. Uh, it was not done at that point of time, and I faced a significant amount of resistance. Uh, but because Jira does that, what was not known at that time was Jira was developing a dashboard, and they had a very decent dashboard at that point of time. Now there was a small cost that we lost. Like, a little bit of business was lost because we could have built that dashboard in Excel at that point of time and made some money, but we wanted to show the client value because we were building trust. There was an existing vendor. So we used the Jira dashboard. It became centralized because the client could see that we were more interested in giving them value rather than actually, um, you know, taking money out of them. Uh, we build tremendous integrity and trust with them. And then we will start we were able to put in a lot of extra work, uh, from a funding perspective because, of course, billing is everything. Uh, and we were able to bring in headcount. So while we lost a little bit of money in creating a dashboard, which was pre pre prepared or pre created by Jira for which we made no money, the fact that we introduced it to them, uh, got us a lot of trust points, and we built integrity with them. They actually liked it so much to scale it across the organization, uh, and we were able to show them how to use the tool up to a point after which, of course, once they started bringing other vendors, uh, we withdrew from there. Uh, but we were able to bring an extra headcount because they could see that we were only charging for what we were doing, uh, and we had a long term relation because of that.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've leveraged Jira effectively to not only manage the project but also to build trust and demonstrate value to your client. The use of dashboards for transparency is particularly noteworthy. Shifting focus a bit, you mentioned your experience with UI wireframing and UX digital customer experience study. Can you discuss how you've applied these skills in your projects, particularly in the insurance domain, and how they've contributed to the success of your initiatives?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Actually, this was a happy accident. Uh, I was actually at the client location, and I was, uh, able to, uh, make friends with many people. And I went for a user experience demo. Uh, at that point of time, user experience was primarily known in US. Of course, now because India is digitized, you can see those projects here also. Uh, but what they were doing was they were building something on a mobile phone, uh, for users because, uh, this client realized that they were not at the forefront of the customer's mind when it came to digital purchases, and, uh, they wanted to be there. So they had actually invited another vendor to do this. Uh, and I was, um, well, I was strategic enough to get invited to that, uh, uh, presentation. Uh, at that point of time, I saw what was happening, uh, and I understood that, uh, you know, they had different age groups of customers. A user experience survey is where you bring people of different age groups into your office. At least this is what this client used to do traditionally. Uh, and they would come in and they would be exposed, uh, to the POCs, The proof of concept that another vendor had created. And what I could see was that while they had done a tremendous amount of work on the UI, they had not thought about the UX part of it. Uh, and these are 2 very different things. So the end customer experience, uh, from the UX perspective was not very positive. But UI was very good because they were trying to bring in, uh, a UI which was diverse. So for people who can't read small print, uh, for people who are older, who may not be able to type as quickly, so on and so forth. As you have to understand, this is a slightly older project. Uh, now, of course, you can use voice, uh, but at that point, that was not an available function. Uh, so I saw the the the gap. And as you can see in my CV, I started my career in IT from a gap analysis perspective. So I'm trained to look for gaps. And what I understood was while the UI experience was very good, adoption was poor. And they were trying to understand why that was, and that was because UX experience across the board was very poor. And UX is, of course, completely different because you are looking at everything, usability, how the brand comes across, uh, what kind of trust it's communicating because you know you're using your cell phone, and your demographic may not necessarily be young. Uh, and as you can see, as the market is changing, the demographic is not necessarily investing in certain kind of insurance products, uh, but you want to pull them in. So you create a great design from a UI perspective. But your traditional customer actually can scale and purchase. You lost them because you're running after a younger customer, and you're losing your cash cow because you won the star. So I understood that, uh, and I was very lucky I understood that was because I was in the right place at the right time, very frankly speaking. And I understood that, and I was able to go back and document this, um, because I am traditionally a BA, and I could put my analysis in a quick snapshot. I could share it with my c suite management, and we were able to go and pitch that this is why you are not getting pickup from your core customer. Because while you are able to show great UI, uh, the UX experience is not good. And the customer drops in a million. Or they don't close once they've closed their transaction, they don't want to come back and use digital to buy your product, so they go somewhere else. So this is how I used UI UX, and I studied at that point of time. It was not an area where I had a lot of exposure. So I scaled at that point of time. I had to do it quickly because there were multiple vendors in the race. Um, but we were able to make a a good dent because we had displayed trust throughout our experience with them. They had a very good experience with us. They knew that we are not going to gouge them, basically. So we got that business.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your ability to identify and address the gap between UI and UX, especially in the context of diverse user needs and demographics, is quite insightful. It's clear that you've been able to pivot and apply your analytical skills to a new area, ultimately benefiting the project and the client. Given your experience with Agile methodologies, how have you integrated UI/UX considerations into your sprint planning and product backlogs to ensure that these aspects are not overlooked in the development process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: That is a very, very good question. Uh, so, yes, uh, it was very challenging because the back end developer will not necessarily marry with the front end developer, and the skills that are required, especially for UX design, are significantly different from people who are actually doing back end development. So we had to bring in that integration point. We had to buy that scale from the market, and we had to scale within our team. Uh, what we did in Jira was we actually broke out the tasks under a given, uh, you know, project in such a way that when we developed it, the end result of done, uh, if you follow business analysis and if you follow what a requirement means, the definition of a requirement delivery is the definition of done. So I define done very properly. That is the number one thing you require to deliver successfully. What is the definition of done? The definition of done was that the integration points between back end and front end had to be seamless. And the tests that we had put in, which a t shaped developer was required to do because that is where the market was going, uh, because traditional developers who have been trained in the last decade or decade and a half don't understand t shaped delivery. It is a concept which has been introduced now, But people who are in the market with 5, 8, 10, 15 years of experience have never done t shape delivery. So they did not take responsibility for doneness because that was pushed to the VA and the tester. So we had to bring that rigor into the Jira itself. So we connected the Jira to the actual delivery point so that when you are standing and cutting the branching gate and you're going to deliver it, at that point of time, once the code has run, once the production cycle is over and we are doing the postmortem of the release, at that point of time, we can only say it's done if it's actually working seamlessly. And that was brought into the Jira with different tasks, and we would not consider that task complete till you could prove through intensive testing. And you have to work together as developers because test budgets were being cut because developer. Uh, and some testing, you cannot use automation. You need manual ready tester. Because there was no budget, I did it. Uh, and we made sure we delivered. So once the client saw that there was a need for traditional testers, which were, uh, technical and UAT, we got the budget to bring in some technical testers manual testers.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've taken a comprehensive approach to ensure that the integration between front-end and back-end development is seamless, with a strong emphasis on the definition of done and the use of Jira to track these integration points. Your strategy to enforce TDD and the responsibility for testing within the development team is a key aspect of Agile practices. Given your experience with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, how do you tailor your communication to ensure that both groups understand the technical complexities and the business implications of your projects?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Up again. It's a very good question. It's a very challenging question to answer because every situation is different a lot depends on the maturity actually of your developer. See the product owner who will come from the functional side or the operational side is coming with a specific knowledge of what they want. They don't necessarily know how it will be done the Person who is coming from the technical side knows how it will be done but doesn't understand what it means for it to function and the functional world and sorry for the double function there. The thing that happens is I mentioned before developers have traditionally not been trained in the last decade or two things from a functional perspective, which is a core requirement of a t-shirt developer. So you have to bring that practice in and a lot of it depends on the resistance. You will get from the developer traditionally a business analyst is going to face that challenge because it is they are responsibility to ensure delivery is done and definition of done has been met and the technical skill that brings in is going to be the thing on which you are going to prove that. But for that your technical resource has to understand it. So there are a lot of meetings that are down in the starting where you bring the developer to the meeting on 199% of the time at least at that point of time because they are just interested in what has to be done. They look at the technical spec and they will go in building but now or at least that point of time so something I was doing and I didn't realize eventually I was eliminating BS from the market, but I would force my developers to come and sit over there. At least I used to make the lead. And eventually the guy was on the lady who was actually supposed to sit and go. I reached that point it took me over four months to achieve that level of trust within my own team that the person who's been assigned the jira. She comes to that meeting and understands the challenge. I will give you an example. We were doing a migration from ux to reach us who are kind of screen and developer was not interested in speaking to the end user or listening to the ba in this case me. And they will the screen in react and what they didn't realize was that the person who was using the Unix platform. They were actually using keyboard. They never touched their Mouse the operational guy never touches the mouse. And the developer did not consider that. And because they did not consider that extreme did not pass through in front of the client when we positioned for POC because they said well my operational user has to use about they don't use Mouse houses. They just report and what the developer had not thought of first thing. You should make it happen. Now I did this deliberately because this was a challenging situation. I had a everything in writing but to developer was not interested and I made the developers sit in that session and see the interaction. We were having they were not participating they were offering we did not expose our and put them in front of the client to show all this is the error it was not about finger pointing. So what explaining what the client was expecting? And then as we brought in agile processes, like I started bringing in the product owner I started. Bringing in that rigor that you have to understand what they are asking for. They will not know how to do it. That's where you come in you show how it's done. But they will only value what you have done is then it does what they want to do. And that's how I was able to build in the river. So initially you do some meetings. Now the market is more mature in my last assignment. It took me a little bit of time because this was this team was not used to Agile. But once they came and realized it was not about finger pointing or blaming and understanding what their actual requirement was. This is what you need to develop. They don't want to know how beautiful your code is. They want to know if they're going to get and once you understand the process, which I will explain and I will show you so let me Demo it first. So this is how I did it, but it took time it's there is no TurnKey solution over here. It depends how much are the team is there it is on the agile and how interested people are in growing and learning rather than costing.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders is quite strategic, emphasizing the importance of developer involvement in meetings and the demonstration of user interactions to drive understanding. It's also commendable how you've managed to instill a culture of learning and collaboration within your team. Given your experience with Agile and the challenges you've faced in introducing these practices, how do you measure the success of your Agile implementation, and what metrics do you typically use to track the team's progress and the project's health?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: There is only one and only one way in it, but they use agile whether you use waterfall whether you use any kind of system definition of done must be like if it is meant you are successful if it has not met no number of tools are going to help you. So the tools are there to help you achieve the objective. If you are going to put the tools in front of the objective, then your project will fail. You have to understand the mentality of the people you're working with because while I'm giving this interview in Ai, and I know the future is AI people are still traditionally working in teams and you have to make sure that they understand that definition of done is everything everything else is something which is going to help you achieve. Your objective agile is a tool it will only work if you are able to influence the mindset and for that you need money management support. But if you don't get it and you still have to deliver then you have to keep the focus of the team of definition of done and you have to show them that they have to partner with each other. All the agile tools whether it is the scrum ceremony, we teach everything and I have done training across all the global Level Training and rollouts by creating Frameworks and then customizing them to Deals. There is no one size fits all in agile and scrum also works differently. I have worked in teens where a scrum to 405 minutes which is unheard of because a scrubs ceremony should not go more than 1150 minutes. If you can keep it under 10, you will really well, but you need a level of maturity in the team, which is not as Be found because this is a practice you have to build rigor that takes time because you're changing people's mindsets. So I've used all agile tools, but we have to remember the tool is not bigger than delivery at the end of the day delivery is definition of done being night and product for the signing of product process. Yes, you have done it. That's it. But yes, you have to use the tools which are going to help you fashionable to use each other right now. It's fashionable to say you were scrum. But I've gone to scrum which are two hours long, which is nothing more than a status meeting. And then you have to change the mindset. It took me eight months to change the mindset of one particular team, which went from two hours to 17 minutes. And it was a journey. So we have to remember that every tool is valuable and you must use technology but point of using technology.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', \"Interviewee: Start the interview? Yes. Yes. I'm ready.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have extensive experience in the full software lifecycle, particularly in the financial services sector. Could you walk me through a complex project you led from inception to completion, focusing on the challenges you faced and how you overcame them?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yeah. So, um, I work currently, um, for a company called Envestnet, and they have, um, a platform called, uh, Unified Asset Management Platform, which is for all the asset managers, uh, who are working on for all the asset managers, uh, who are working on trading within the platform. It was a complicated project because we had to cater to many customers and their preferences. Uh, because all asset management management firms, they work on a variety of modules. So we had to talk to a lot of clients, uh, a lot of financial advisers get their opinion on what they require from a reporting perspective. And daily had to, uh, you know, uh, from the time I log in till I log out, I had around 4 to 5 meetings over 1 hour for the initial to, uh, 1 to 2 months to understand the requirements of each of these firms and the financial adviser of the advisers of these firms. So I have to consolidate all of their requirements and uh, make that into a business requirement document, um, and, uh, ensure that this is achieved. All of their, uh, goals are achieved in the platform in the reporting module. And this was a great challenge because, um, our development team also, uh, this was one of the first times, uh, in which they were working on such such kind of an effort. But, thankfully, over the course of around 6 months, I was able to aggregate all of the requirements, consolidate, find the common ground, and, uh, form a, uh, critical and extensive business requirement document as well as a functional requirement document. I also, uh, use the stories on top of that and coordinate with, uh, our stakeholders, uh, investment management firms as well as our development team and ensure that we, uh, build a stable and robust reporting module which caters to all the audience. And finally, after the client demo, we got to know, uh, from the feedback of all the clients that they were all pretty happy with, uh, what we achieved and gave us a rating of 9 plus out of 10. So that was one of the most, uh, defining points of my career and something which I was really proud about because this is not an easy effort, uh, to pull off.\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a significant achievement, especially considering the level of client engagement and the positive feedback you received. Given the complexity of the project, how did you ensure that the development team stayed on track with the constantly evolving requirements, and what Agile methodologies or tools did you find most effective in managing this project?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. So we as far as agile methodology is con concerned, we follow the scrum, uh, model in which I also played the role of a scrum lead. We had daily scrum calls. We had 2 weeks sprints, and we had a goal for each sprint. And it was my responsibility to make sure that every day, uh, uh, in the stand up call, which we have for around 15 minutes, I have all the developers in my team, all the product managers, all the product owners, everyone involved, and make sure that everyone stays on track, um, on making sure that this the sprint goals are achieved. And a daily tracking mechanism I ensured, uh, that we all follow to make sure that everyone is on the same page. And, uh, after the, uh, after the development effort of, uh, a single sprint is done, we made sure that we conducted client demos to, um, after the sprint to all of the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, what they had in mind is what we developed. And if by any chance there is any, uh, small deviation or change request that is coming from the customer, uh, after seeing the demo. We, um, uh, it was my responsibility to make sure that, um, the development team is in sync with what the client wants. And, uh, we track that as a separate change request and make sure that it is also fitted into the scrum model, uh, framework. So it it was basically coordinating, uh, among all of the stakeholders with me being the central focal point, um, and making sure that, uh, you know, the the sprint goals are achieved in the end.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you played a pivotal role in maintaining alignment and delivering value incrementally. Given your experience with Agile and your role as a Scrum Lead, how do you approach sprint planning to ensure that the team can consistently meet their commitments, especially when dealing with a high degree of client customization and potentially volatile requirements?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Sprint planning. Um, so before the start of every sprint, uh, we have a sprint planning meeting on, um, each Thursday. So the scrum meeting so the scrum, uh, start is on every Monday, uh, after 2 weeks. So the the Thursday before this, uh, the sprint start, we have a sprint planning meeting which goes on for 3 to 4 hours. So it is my responsibility to make sure that all the user stories are groomed before the sprint planning meeting so that we have a good backlog of user stories that we that we can assign to the sprint. And also not only assigning the stories to the backlog, but making sure that, uh, the team is well versed with all the stories and what the requirements of all the stories are that are in the backlog. Then in the sprint planning session, we make sure that, uh, the team is comfortable in picking stories for the sprint. Um, I give a clear idea to them on what the sprint goals are and take their opinion, and we discuss the stories in the backlog, uh, on, um, what we need to do on what stories we need to pick to achieve this sprint goal. And we I the it is also, uh, the prerogative of the developer to kind of give their feedback on letting me know and and the rest of the team know on which all stories they can pick to achieve that the sprint goals are achieved. And once we have an alignment on which all stories that the developers are going to pick, we'd we kind of, uh, drag that into the sprint bucket, assign it to the developer's name. And, uh, um, I also kind of do a daily tracking as I said earlier to make sure that everything is on track, and all of the stories that we assigned to sprint are kind of following the sprint schedule. And in case of any, um, uh, questions or queries from the development team on any of the stories that come up, it's, uh, uh, it's my responsibility to make sure that I get them answered on time. Even if I don't have the answer, uh, I make sure that I kind of follow-up with the product managers or the clients or the stakeholders, conduct meetings, conduct, uh, regular follow-up feedback sessions to make sure that I get the queries across to them on time. And this kind of ensures that, uh, you know, our sprint, uh, stays on schedule.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: You've outlined a thorough approach to sprint planning and team collaboration. Given your experience with client feedback and change requests, how do you manage scope creep during a project, and what strategies have you found most effective in communicating changes to both the development team and the stakeholders?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So scope creep is one of the major problems, uh, that can come during software implementation. So it and I also don't think it's in many of the cases, it's not anyone's fault also because, you know, as project evolves, uh, people, the stakeholders, everyone involved in the project kind of understand the module a little bit more and more of, uh, what they want. So as their understanding evolves, their requirements also kind of evolves. So they the the stakeholders usually come to me and let me know in case they want something more added to the scope or a change that, uh, they need a need on top of something that we already planned. So my approach to always change request or a scope creep is always an I, uh, I kind of take in everything that the client wants us to do, uh, or the update that they want us to do. And I do not give them any commitment at the first instance. I go back to my team first. I discuss with them, uh, especially my technical architects. Uh, I get that, uh, kind of effort that is required to do this, uh, update in scope. And, uh, whether it's a minor change or a major change, how many mandates are required to implement this. And, uh, after evaluating this, uh, at, uh, the kind of work and the effort that is required with the development team and the architects, I take that as a change request. If it's if it's if it's a, uh, an update to the already existing scope, I take that as a change request. And if it's, um, kind of important to the client, I mark that as high priority. There's also a prioritization mechanism where I kind of tag the the request as high, medium, or low. Any high priority request, we try to add it into the next sprint itself to make sure that it kind of gets into the sprint cycle and as part of the sprint objectives. It's a low priority. It is taken only in the later, uh, sprints after the initial objectives are achieved. And the change requests are also separately tracked, and if it's, uh, and, uh, if it's required, it's separately built, and and make sure that this is communicated to the clients and the developers, um, uh, in tandem so that everyone, uh, is in sync with, whatever new updates that are coming on into the project so that everyone is on the same page, um, on the project details.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: You've provided a clear strategy for managing scope changes and ensuring that everyone is informed and aligned. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you have experience with Java/J2EE. Can you discuss a particularly challenging technical problem you solved using these technologies and how you approached it?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So I used to be a Java developer in the earlier part of my career when I started off. But, uh, around 1 or 2 years into my development role, I shifted into a business analyst role, uh, into a purely functional role and shifted away from the technical role. So it's been a long time since I've worked on Java, directly as a developer. But if you if I have to talk about the initial part of my development experience. Um, one of the projects that I implemented that was a bit, um, uh, tricky and, uh, uh, was, uh, required a lot of effort from my side was I implemented a a rating algorithm for, um, a company called Allianz. So Allianz is an insurance provider, and they have this, uh, motor insurance, pet insurance, home insurance. So they have, uh, a rating algorithm that runs in the back end, and it kind of after fetching the details of a customer, it kind of computes the rate of the insurance quote that is, um, that the customer has to pay in order to get the insurance, uh, assigned to them, uh, or in in order for them to buy the insurance. So as part of this rating, there was, uh, this fraud check algorithm that I had to implement based on the details of the customer. There was a web service that I needed to call, um, in order to fix, um, any kind of, um, kind of fraud that this customer had previously done, uh, which was tracked um, in the UK database, uh, with their name and the type of fraud that they've done, any kind of, um, you know, um, credit card fraud or late payments or anything of that sort or any, uh, insurance that, uh, they have not paid or they have not, uh, settled. All of the these details, uh, was stored in a central repository, and I had to call that central repository and fetch the details of the customer, bring it into my application, and make sure that this customer, uh, can be trusted with an insurance quote. So it was a very complicated project, calling an external web service and making sure that the details are, um, aligned with the company's policy so that so that a good insurance quote can be given to the customer. I had an on-site experience where I had to travel to, uh, Allianz London office in Surrey, uh, in the UK. Uh, had to, uh, discuss with a lot of the stakeholders, the Allianz Insurance Divisions, uh, the underwriters, everyone get a perspective on what business requirements they wanted. Uh, so I also play dual role of business analyst also in the project, uh, on top of the technical role. So which is why I thought I was good in this role, and I purely shifted into a technical role after this project. Yeah.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's interesting to hear about your transition from a technical role to a more business-oriented one and how you've leveraged both skill sets in your projects. Given your experience with the rating algorithm and the integration of external services, how do you approach testing and quality assurance in such a scenario, especially when dealing with sensitive data like fraud checks?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So, uh, in this project, it was testing was a very crucial part. The quality assurance were, like, also a really crucial part because and I needed to make sure that the data is correct and working perfectly. So it couldn't be just manual testing. We, uh, we had to work closely with the QA team, the testing team to make sure that, uh, a good amount of automation testing, um, automated tools were implemented to make sure that the response that we get from the rating algorithm is perfect. It doesn't have any errors. A first level of check was done by the algorithm itself, uh, the testing algorithm, uh, the automation tool itself to make sure that the response we get from this web service was correct. Uh, the data that we match to our customer is correct. All of this were taken care by automation test tasks. Uh, so this was really helpful. This was something that we already planned, um, even well ahead of the project. And on top of this automated testing, we also implemented a good manual testing strategy, uh, with a variety of test cases, variety of customers, variety of fraud test cases to make sure that, um, all the testing coverage is tracked in our project. So this is a good success. We even got an award for, um, uh, the testing strategy that we follow for the project. It it it it actually worked really perfectly when we went live into production. Yeah. I think we had close to 0 critical defects coming out of this project. So that was a big achievement. And, uh, kind of a kudos to our entire team, uh, with, uh, you know, the testing strategy that we followed.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that your testing strategy was so successful and that it led to minimal critical defects. Given your experience with both automated and manual testing, how do you ensure that the testing process is integrated seamlessly into the development lifecycle, particularly in an Agile environment?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah in an agile, and we aren't meant. What I try to ensure is that you know, this this the stories that we assign to a Sprint a tested within a Sprint itself. So this is a key aspect of making sure the spring goals are achieved. So this kind of requires a close alignment with the test and the developers. So in case we have a two weeks print we make sure that the stories are all not kind of implemented or finished at the end of a Sprint. So the QA team does not get time to test the tasks. So any stories that have finished let's say do or three days into the Sprint is given quickly to the QA team. From the development team. I arrange meeting with with the dev and the khui team. So that that's a knowledge transfer that is happening in the qas. Well was with what the developer has done. and the stories that are finished quickly in the front end of a Sprint is tested quickly and moved. to testing finished status Um even during the first week of a Sprint rather than waiting for the end of the Sprint. So this make sure that we we get enough time to what's the end of the Sprint to kind of take on stories that are a bit more complicated. So this kind of requires a close planning, you know, close collaboration between all the team members to make sure that the stories that we kind of, you know, give to the uat testing. Or to the business users for testing. I kind of qwave verified and of good quality. so the the daily Sprint meetings The Daily Standard meetings help a lot in this kind of coordination effort. And the testing strategies also included in our spring planning meetings to make sure that the QA team is also aware of when they are going to get the stories the developers in jira where the user stories are tracked. We also make sure that there is a testing start date on top of a Dev completion date and the testing and date which was kind of helps us to track all these events separately. and make sure that all of these goals are achieved in collaboration.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate A has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate A Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Ready to start the interview? Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've led Scrum teams and managed automation initiatives at HCL. Can you elaborate on a specific challenge you faced while driving these automation initiatives and how you overcame it?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: You overcame it? Yeah. So one of the challenges that I faced was, uh, training the team to, uh, uh, handle the, uh, tools. So they were not, uh, specific on how to learn the tools. So we had the training team and collaborated with the training team. And, uh, accordingly, uh, they were trained. So they actually productively, uh, contributed to the automation, uh, drive.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Training team collaboration sounds crucial. How did you measure the effectiveness of this training program, and what adjustments did you make based on those measurements?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Those measurements. Yeah. Uh, so, uh, we evaluated the team members, uh, by having assessment, by giving them assessment after each module. So the training was actually, uh, um, cut into, like, uh, 3 or 4 pieces of training. Initial introduction and, uh, the other parts of technical, uh, tool training. So for each phase, we had assessment. So wherein we came to know the team members where they had the weakness. And that way, the training was helpful by the assessment, particular assessment. And, also, we had a test drive wherein, uh, team members were made to work on the test, uh, cases. That way, we understood where the strengths and what they further need to be trained.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to training evaluation. Shifting focus a bit, you've also worked on metrics management and ensuring SLA compliance. Can you discuss the key metrics you tracked for a project and how you used that data to maintain SLA compliance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Compliance. Yeah. So the key metrics that I have, uh, tracked during the project is productivity and quality. So those 2 are the major metrics, uh, which contributes to about, uh, 30 percentage and 30 percentage. Overall, 60 percentage goes to productivity and quality. And other metrics is apart from that where, uh, the customer satisfaction scores that we get from the, uh, clients and also the, uh, utilization of the team team utilization, how they do their productivity on a daily basis, and the compliance part and security part. So these are all the metrics that I have, uh, tracked. And, specifically, uh, also, we gave some points to the, uh, assessment scores from the training. So overall, contributed to 100%. That's how we track the metrics.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Focusing on productivity and quality makes sense. How did you ensure that the team remained focused on these key metrics, especially during high-pressure periods, and how was this reflected in your project management approach?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Management approach. Yeah. So during, uh, peak peak periods, what we do is, like, uh, conduct some floor activities to ensure that the team members don't get stressed out, especially during the peak period, wherein they have to continuously work on the, uh, system. So some kind of floor activities were planned using the, uh, HR invention, uh, HR intervention. Uh, so human resource team collaboration, we organize some fun activities in the floor wherein it's not a long term activity, but a short activity, which made them feel relaxed and work, uh, confidently on the day. That is one thing. And with regards to project management side, what we did was, like, uh, ensure that they had the feedback given properly at consistent intervals. So giving feedback as part of the quality management tools and QMP, the quality management principles were deployed. So those are all some of the main activities for quality which we did. And for productivity, the matrices were discussed with the team leads or the team members productivity were discussed with the team leads. So they actually helped groom them productivity.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Incorporating HR interventions for team morale is innovative. How did you quantify the impact of these HR interventions on team performance, and did you make any adjustments to these activities based on the feedback received from the team?  \\n', \"Interviewee: See from the team. Yeah. So for for example, for one of the activity, uh, we did was the floor activity. It's kind of a fun activity, and, uh, the team members, those who are not talking much or not, uh, mingling much with the team members, they were actually voluntarily pulled to ensure that they also speak and, uh, have a good network with the team so that the teamwork, uh, gets stronger. That is one aspect, uh, which which we learned as part of the HR intervention. So HR gave this some of the factors. So picking people who are not much talking or something, which which actually help them to groom their, uh, communication skills also. And, uh, the feedback given was, uh, very quite, uh, this is the feedback. The teamwork was improved.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understanding the impact on team dynamics is insightful. Shifting to a more technical focus, you've listed Quality Assurance as one of your skills. Can you describe a particularly challenging QA issue you've encountered and how you resolved it within a project, focusing on the specific methodologies or tools you employed?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: You employed. Yeah. So one of the issues which while working on the project was, uh, there were a number of errors, uh, the team members were making, especially the newcomers and the, uh, freshers. So, uh, a lot of training programs were arranged to overcome these errors. And, uh, they those members were pulled out from the production, and they were deployed into test production wherein we measure their test scores. So gradually, they improve this course week on week and by within 2 weeks, they were able to achieve the, uh, required productivity and I mean, the quality achieve the quality. So the SLA was 95 percentage. They actually contribute at 97 and above, which was a good thing. And other thing which had was we deployed some of the tools like the fishbone diagram, uh, the 80 20 Pareto rule. So fishbone diagram actually, uh, explains the number of errors and how we can, uh, uh, by arrive and control the errors. Error control in the kind of system deployed like fishbone and, uh, 80 20 Pareto rule, concentrating on the major error and so that that actually, uh, reduced much of the other errors.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Leveraging training and deployment to test environments is effective. How did you measure the effectiveness of the Fishbone diagram and the 80/20 rule in reducing errors, and were there any unexpected challenges in implementing these methodologies or tools in your QA process?  \\n', 'Interviewee: To a process. No. Those tools were, uh, absolutely helpful. And, uh, so we came to know that the number of errors, the type of errors, especially. So for example, numerical errors, typo errors, and conceptual errors, these are all the categorization we had in the error list. So those errors were, um, concentrated, and some of the numerical errors had high impact to the client. So those, uh, diagrams actually help to understand how where the, uh, production team makes the, uh, numerical errors and how we can improve it. So, accordingly, training was arranged as per the, uh, error, uh, the team had. So that actually helped.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Understanding the categorization of errors is key to targeted improvement. How did you design the training programs to specifically address the different types of errors, and what was the impact on error reduction for each category after the training initiatives?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Training initiatives. Yeah. So the training program was, uh, arranged, uh, in collaboration with the training team. So there was a trainer specifically assigned for this project. So, uh, the trainer was also part of the team. So he knows the key, uh, errors, and he understands the process. So we discussed with him the number of errors the team were making and where, uh, the contribution was high. The chart was discussed there chart. And, accordingly, the training program was arranged, uh, to we had groups specific groups for, uh, different trainings. So each group, uh, not everyone attended all the trainings. So targeted groups were, uh, allocated for specific trainings. For example, numerical errors, we had a separate team. And for typo and the conceptual errors, there are different teams. So those kind of, uh, training arrangements are made, and that was really successful. So once after the training, we tested them, had a written test and online test, and we understood that about 90 percentage of people were able to grasp it and, uh, come through of the training, and 10 percentage, we had a retraining and tested them again. That helped.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Targeted training for specific error types is a strategic approach. How did you measure the effectiveness of the training for each group, and what methodologies or tools did you use to conduct the pre and post-training assessments to ensure the 90% grasp rate you mentioned?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Break you mentioned. Yeah. So the free training, we had a a questionnaire filled up by the team to understand where they are at the, uh, status quo. So as per the current status, where they were. Uh, after filling the questionnaire, we came to know that, uh, where they were. And, uh, accordingly, the training plan was arranged. So once after the training, we had a post, uh, training questionnaire given to the team. And, uh, we came to know that their training and, uh, their knowledge has improved after the training, definitely. So from the 90 percentage that I mentioned, how I came to know is the, uh, entire team, uh, scores had numerical errors and errors. But after the training, uh, the the out of, uh, 50 people, about 45 people were able to cross the 90 so on percentage quality. From this, we understand that the 90 percentage is achieved.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using pre and post-training questionnaires is a solid assessment method. How about the written and online tests, were they standardized across all groups, and what kind of questions or scenarios were included to evaluate the team's understanding of the material?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Of the material. Yeah. So for this online tests, uh, uh, there were several contributions from, uh, one from the trainer directly and, uh, some from the project managers and the team leads. They gave a lot of questions. The, uh, number of questions were pulled in, and, uh, we arrived at, like, uh, say, a lot of, like, 2 to 3 questions. And from there, we picked randomly picked the for the online questions methodology. So each time the test will keep changing. The not all the same questions will be repeating for the same numbers. So that way, we were able to assure that, uh, each team member had a different questionnaire and, uh, they also understood the concepts clearly.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Randomizing the questions ensures a fair assessment of understanding. How did you ensure that the questions covered a wide enough range of scenarios to truly test the team's comprehension, and were there any feedback mechanisms in place for team members to comment on the clarity or effectiveness of the training material based on their test experiences?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Experiences. Yes. So, uh, we also had a feedback mechanism after the test. The trainer actually collected feedback from the team members to understand that, uh, the, uh, online assessment was fair. So we came to know that, like, few questions were, uh, little bit contradicting with the, uh, current process, and, uh, that were actually corrected. So what happened was there were few updates from clients. We used to get the regular updates from client. So those are all the key points. Uh, I think the trainer didn't have a much of connect. So those are corrected based on the feedback. That really helped.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Incorporating feedback into the assessment process is a great way to ensure the fairness and relevance of the tests. How did you manage the updates from the client to ensure that the training material remained current and aligned with the evolving processes, and what was the impact of this feedback-driven approach on the team's performance and understanding?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: And understanding. Yeah. So, actually, I was the person who was, uh, in charge of the updates and clarification process for the entire project. So what I did was I had a manual updates manual, uh, specifically designed for the project wherein, uh, date wise, as per the project management style, we had, uh, date wise and subject wise, uh, updates manual ready for the team. So it is put in the centralized location where a team was able to go through the manual anytime while they were, uh, processing the, uh, claims or anything. So they were able to get the, uh, recent updates from the client. So this one, we also had daily refreshes in the morning to understand, uh, uh, what the client updates were, and we explained them to the team as well. So both ways really helped.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Creating a centralized updates manual is a proactive approach to keeping the team informed. How did you measure the effectiveness of this communication strategy in terms of its impact on error reduction, productivity, and team morale, and were there any challenges in ensuring that the daily refreshes and manual updates remained comprehensive and easily understandable for the team?  \\n', 'Interviewee: For the team. Yeah. So, um, what happened was the client used to send in their language through email or during the calls, uh, daily calls, they, uh, mention the updates. So we actually simplify it for the team so that they understand in, uh, simple English. We put it in a way that the team understands it. And, also, we ensure that during the daily refreshes, we talk about the updates and randomly pick, uh, team members to again, uh, talk about the updates to to to understand that they also, uh, know the updates clearly. So that way we reassured that the team had, uh, updates, uh, clearly mentioned, and it was simplified for them.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Simplifying client updates for your team is a great strategy to ensure everyone stays on the same page. How do you ensure that the updates are accurately simplified, and what mechanisms do you have in place to verify that the team has understood the updates correctly, and what was the impact of this on the team's performance and understanding?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: And understanding. Yeah. So, uh, it is directly impacting in their quality. So what are the updates we get from the client? So, uh, during the weekly quality reports, we, uh, come to know that, uh, if some of the members had done errors on that specific update. So we arranged a training for that team, uh, member. So, um, we came to know that, um, so the team member has not understood the update based on the quality. It is evident in the quality report. So they make errors based on those updates. So they are not aware. Maybe they would have been absent or some of the mechanisms that we had, people who are absent on a particular day, the team lead will, uh, share the updates on the next day, and, also, they mandated them to look at the updates and have a manual for signing to ensure that they have actually, uh, seen the updates and they are aware of it. So the signing mechanism was just followed across the team.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Using quality reports to identify and address understanding gaps is a strategic use of data. How do you ensure that the training provided after such incidents is effective in bridging the gap, and do you have any metrics or methods to measure the impact of this targeted training on error reduction and understanding, and how was this reflected in the team's performance and understanding?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Then understanding. So, uh, these trainings were conducted, uh, as I already mentioned for the specific targeted groups. Not everybody were, uh, pulled in the training. So those who had below, uh, 95 percentage SLA were pulled into the training, and they were given assessments and understood, uh, about the current updates and other processes. So after the assessment, if some of the team members didn't achieve the, uh, required, uh, percentage, so they were again assessed and retrained into the concepts and, uh, put into test phase of production. So through test phase of production, what we did was we had a shadowing process. So some of the lead, uh, production team, uh, they were made to shadow and understand how they work. So that way, actually, the shadowing helped them. And the assessment, uh, how it impacted was, there was no issues. After the training assessment, the team were able to give good performance. We evidently saw this.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Implementing a shadowing process is a great way to ensure practical understanding. How do you conduct the assessments to ensure that team members are ready to go back to full production, and do you have any specific methods or tools in place to measure their readiness, and how was this readiness reflected in the team's performance and understanding?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: And understanding. Yeah. So once, uh, they were put into shadow, uh, shadowing and, uh, in the test case production, what we do is the quality team, uh, assesses their full production. Instead of doing sampling quality, the quality team does a full quality check on their entire week's production. So that way we came to know that where the actual quality is, the average of growing quality, actual quality. So if suppose, uh, we categorized the, uh, percentage as red, uh, green, and yellow amber. So red, if the people follow in red that is below 90 percentage, they will not go into production. They will be further into the test phase for 1 more week. If they were in amber phase between 95 to 97, they'll be put in a controlled production wherein instead of, uh, processing 100 cases, they'll be processing, like, uh, 60 percentage or 50 percentage based on their efficiency. If they were in the green phase, they'll be put into the full production. That's how we, uh, monitor the, um, their production after the, uh, test cases and the training.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Using a full quality check after training and shadowing is a rigorous way to ensure readiness. How do you differentiate between the categories (red, amber, green) in terms of the criteria for quality, efficiency, and understanding, and do you have any feedback loops in place to continuously improve the training and onboarding process based on the findings from these assessments, and how has this approach impacted the team's performance and understanding over time?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Here so based on the test scores. The team members were categorized into red Amber and green. So continuously the weekly reports based on the weekly reports even after they go into the full production. They were continuously monitored if they were in green continuously. That's a good sign that they have improved. So somebody moved from Amber to Green that is also a good sign. If somebody moved from the Amber stage to a red that is something which we we need to look upon and again rearrange training for them. So if somebody is continuously on a red and they are not improving they are pulled out of the production. Pulled out of the production and that way we ensure that they don't affect the overall productivity. I mean the overall quality they are full of protection put into complete training. So after that a complete assessment is given even if they didn't improve then we will have to move them to the different team or we look for other options for the particular team member that is a very small percentage which doesn't impact the productivity or quality. And something called Carvey was introduced Caribbean the sense like list of team members for put in the Caribbean list. So all the quality team have specific list of team members where they need to use special attention. So those people have done more sampling quality team will do extra 10% sampling to see how they are qualities for every week and assessment to the production.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've made significant contributions to the digital payment space, particularly in product management. Can you walk me through the specific challenges you faced while managing the BBPS product lifecycle at Bajaj Finance, and how you addressed them?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Sure. So, uh, bill payments, uh, is a product that is created by NPCI. And then the architecture is built in such a beautiful way wherein 5 major players are working with, uh, around 22,000 odd billers. Those are live on the platform as as we speak today. The challenges that we face on day to day basis, uh, is on the side of every day there is some or the other biller, uh, you know, top performing billers are fluctuating because of their technical issues. So it includes some migration activity that they are doing it, uh, maybe some new changes or new enhancement that they are doing it, or some issues with their operating units, biller operating units, or the customer operating units. So all those types of challenges that we face on day to day basis. Now coming on to the site, how do we tackle this, uh, challenge is, uh, by implementing. So as per the compliance, uh, we are, uh, an agent institute, and an agent institute can have, uh, 2 operating 2 customer operating units. So we have our onboarded additional, uh, you know, customer operating, uh, unit that is allowing us to at least, uh, you know, reduce our failures by 10 percents by, you know, orchestrating the traffic from 1 o u to the other in the real time as soon as we, uh, reaches, uh, the failure reaches the defined thresholds.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive overview of the challenges with biller fluctuations and the solutions you've implemented. Regarding the orchestration system you mentioned, how did you ensure the real-time traffic orchestration maintained high availability and reliability, especially during peak transaction periods?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So, uh, there are 2 peak periods that we, uh, are, uh, that we usually have. Uh, one is around somewhere between 9 to 12 a PM sorry, AM. And second one is around 4 to 9 PM. So these are the 2, uh, traffic, uh, you know, uh, peak period at which, uh, the traffic is at the max. Now coming on to the how orchestrator works is on the side of the, you know, uh, we have, um, identified that, uh, failure, uh, rates during these peak times. And at these peak times, uh, we define that this is the minimum threshold at which the orchestrator should start dynamically routing the traffic in a, uh, you know, batch manner wherein 10%, 20%, 30% traffic starts getting routed to the, uh, second OU. And this happens at a biller level. So it is comprehensive to biller. As soon as the threshold of let's suppose 95% is the threshold, uh, the the success rate goes below 95%, the 10% traffic goes start, you know, uh, shifting to the uh, other overview that we have. So that's how it works.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Fascinating approach to dynamic traffic routing. Given this dynamic nature, how do you track and analyze the transaction success rates and response times for each biller in real-time, especially considering your background in data visualization and tools like New Relic?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So as you mentioned that, um, um, as as it is mentioned in my resume, the work we have, you know, some automated dashboards that are created on Power BI in New Relic. So these are the 2 tools that we are currently using to monitor or, you know, view our numbers. So we have a real time Power BI dashboards that allow us to, you know, see the numbers that are happening in real time. And New Relic helps us in analyzing the performance of the, uh, key, uh, mobile applications or, uh, front end or back end applications that we are running in order to keep these transactions smoothly. So as soon as the threshold goes beyond, so we have our monitoring team, uh, those, uh, you know, that works directly with the technical team. And there are some other mechanisms that are built in place, uh, wherein the escalations are followed as soon as if the issue is not resolved within x period of time, then the issue gets escalated to the, uh, l two d. So that's how, uh, the dashboards and, uh, New Relic is being used, uh, here.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of monitoring and alerting in maintaining system health, how do you design these alert mechanisms to ensure they are neither too sensitive, causing unnecessary alerts, nor too lax, potentially allowing issues to escalate before detection?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So, uh, the issues, uh, basis the, you know, past 2 years experience, we have divided the, uh, errors into 2 parts. 1 is the business decline. 2nd 1 is the technical decline. Now coming on to the technical decline piece, we have identified certain issues which are, uh, already defined that this could be happening because of, uh, certain reasons. Okay? So for example, there is a migration activity that has been already informed by our operating unit. So for those, uh, the alert mechanism is already, uh, made in such a way wherein we uh, made the changes at the back end that during this period, the biller will not be monitored for for certain types of error. So migration related error codes or certain error codes that are already being identified in the technical declines, which are maintained in an exclusion list in order to reduce the, you know, uh, fake monitoring mails or, uh, alert mechanisms. Apart from that, there is a weekly or fortnightly review that we do, uh, on the trend lines of the failures that are happening in order to ensure that the alerting mechanism are, uh, upgraded with the latest error codes or the latest error trainings that are there.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: I'm impressed by the strategic approach to managing alert mechanisms. Shifting focus a bit, you mentioned leading the development of a BNPL platform at Mswipe Technologies. Can you elaborate on the key technical considerations you had to address to ensure the platform's scalability and security, particularly in the context of integrating with a large number of merchants' systems?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Sure. So, uh, AM Swipe, uh, we were working with, uh, you know, uh, close to 7 or 8, uh, major issuers that are there in India. Apart from that, we our business team was closely, you know, onboarding the top uh, OEMs that are there. So we had around 14 OEMs, and the platform was built for curating the offers for the merchants, those who are, you know, directly working with the, uh, OEMs. So for example, Samsung being the brand, they have already 5,000 merchants that are there. Now they want to roll out some offer on the newly launched phone wherein the 10% discount will be given if the phone is purchased via ICICI Bank credit card. And, uh, the offer is available for a no cost EMI product. So all those configurations are built in that VNPL portal that allowed our OEMs and, uh, issuers to, you know, provide a joint offer to the merchant, which later on can, uh, uh, provide this offer to the end user who is buy who is purchasing the purchasing the project, uh, product of that particular OEM. So this included the 3 types of subvention mechanisms augmented by the issuer, subvention by the brand, and subvention by the merchant. So all 3 types of and mix of 3 was given wherein if issuer and OEM want to, uh, submit the product or merchant and brand want to submit it, the all the types of combinations were built in such a way wherein whatever the type of combination that is coming up, uh, can be taken up on the portal. Apart from that, the portal was uh, made in such a way wherein we were planning to offer it to the players, similar merchant acquiring players, those who are there in the market. Their focus is not more on the technology side. However, their focus was more on the business side, likes of the bank. So the bank focuses on, you know, retaining the customer, activating the customer while not working much on the technology side. So we used to provide our platform in order to increase the scalability of our product.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Given the complex nature of these joint offers and the need to support multiple submission mechanisms, how did you approach the design of the BNPL platform to ensure it remained flexible and easily configurable without requiring extensive rework for each new type of offer or submission process?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So, primarily, there are 4 to 5 types of offer that, uh, usually works in the BNPL space, wherein the subvention is offered by the OEM. So it could be a percentage wise or it could be a flat offer. Then similar type of offer can be offered by the uh, issuer. Okay. These are the majorly two types of, uh, the I mean, these 2 types or 3 types or combination of these 3 types of offers consist or contributes to the 90% of the types of offer that are getting currently created in BNPL space. Now coming on from issuer side, that that they usually allow 3 types of, uh, you know, EMI option. 1 is no cost EMI. 2nd is, uh, EMI with some different, uh, you know, service fees that they want to charge. Then 3rd comes service fees plus, uh, some interest being charged on the EMI. So all these types of exclusive combination of offers were being taken up from the OEMs and, uh, the issuers. Apart from that, uh, we did some, uh, competitive analysis from the players, likes of Pinelabs, what they are doing because they have the, you know, largest market share in terms of the space that we were working in. So within this, uh, basis, the competitive benchmarking and experience from OEMs and issuers, we had exclusive list of offers, and we build the platform in such a way wherein the combination of a plus b plus c are, uh, you know, uh, around 28 parameters that were defined. And those combination can be joined. The dots con can be joined basis the requirement of the OEM slash issuer slash merchant. So the platform was built in such a way wherein any type of offer is coming up. Uh, we were just, you know, making minor, uh, connecting the minor dots that is allowing us to, you know, create offers as per the requirement of the brand.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to categorizing and handling different types of offers and EMI options is quite insightful. Considering the platform's role in facilitating transactions and managing financial terms, how did you ensure the accuracy and security of these transactions, especially in terms of the calculations for interest or service fees, which can be quite complex in financial services products?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So whenever, uh, issuer is onboarded or a brand is onboarded, we use to finalize the transaction file that will be shared with them. And the calculations that are happening will happen on a weekly basis. However, the file will be shared on the, uh, on daily basis. Once the file is shared, then only the funds transfer will happen from brand, uh, to the issuer slash to the, uh, to to us. So that's how, uh, we use to ensure that before making any partner slash brand life, we need to we used to take, you know, confirmation from the brand that whatever the transaction files, whatever the transaction details that they will require in order to perform the reconciliation, uh, we used to do that. Then for phase 1 and and we used to launch the particular brands in a phase manner wherein only 10 to 20 merchants are being enabled on the platform for our 1st month. Once that is done, once confidence is built, then we use to scale it to 1,000 of the merchants as per the brand's confidence.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: The phased approach to onboarding and transaction verification seems robust. Shifting focus to your technical skills, you've listed New Relic and Content Square on your resume. Can you explain how you've utilized Content Square to gain insights into user behavior and inform product decisions, particularly in the context of the digital payment solutions you've managed?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So Content Square, uh, we implemented on my 2 of the products, which was Instaemy Card and, uh, BBPS website. The main intention was to see how why the users were exiting from the each step of the funnel. So we we used a sunburst chart in order to see why users are exiting. So we identified that headers and footers as the had the maximum exit points. So we disabled those exit points and maintain the contact so that content relevant so that user can read and take the informed decision. That was one of the activity that we did. Apart from that, we identified that there were high risk claim that was happening on a contact icon that was given. So the intention of the user was to see the list of the content that that can be populated. So all those issues were identified using ContentSquare, uh, Sunburst charts by identifying the respective step of the funnel and the percent as of the exit that are happening. So that's how we used, uh, ContentSquare and increased our 2% improvement in the funnel.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your use of Content Square for user experience optimization is quite innovative. How did you measure the impact of these changes, particularly the redesign of the contact page, on conversion rates and user engagement, and what were the key metrics you used to evaluate success?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. So the analysis period was the one wherein, uh, in the 1st month in the in 1 month, we identified there are, let's suppose, x number of clicks, so those are happening. From when user is landing from x one page to the x two page, there are a defined, you know, percentage of let's suppose 10% users are, you know, unable to, uh, are getting exited in the uh, x one page itself, and 90% user are landing on x 2. From x 2 to x 3 only, 80% of, uh, the x 2 users are landing, so 20% drop off is there. So there was a metrics was defined when that we used to track on daily basis what is the behavior of the funnel. Okay. When we launched a new feature wherein the user need to fill the complete form, uh, there were some header and footer designs that were changed. So we started to identify that there is a increase of 2 to 3 percent of exits, uh, at each step of the funnel. So, uh, once these issues are identified, we saw some user experience videos wherein user were getting exited, user were clicking on, uh, some icons which were nonapplicable. So those were identified in the month 1. In m 2, we implemented those changes. We monitored it for a month. In the similar way, the way we were monitoring it for the m one. We we particularly check, you know, hundreds of videos in order to see why user is clicking it. We started calling. We tried to understand why user wants to click on the icon. What are the expectations? So basis there, the changes were implemented in m 2. Accordingly, in the similar fashion, we tracked down all the defined, uh, KPIs that, uh, were defined at the m one end and specifically on the issues that were identified. So the key KPIs that we identified on the, uh, that we tracked in the m two was on the size of the number of clicks that are happening, how many users are opening the page, what is the total time spent, how many clicks are happening on that particular instance that is being re modified, how many users are spending time on the on respective pages. So these are some of the key parameters that, uh, we started to analyze from m two.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The detailed approach to tracking user behavior and engagement through Content Square is impressive. How did you use the data from Content Square to iterate on the design and content of the pages, and what role did user feedback play in this iterative process?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So contact, uh, content square allows us to, you know, uh, see the heat map of the page at what section of the page user is interacting or spending most of the most of the time, uh, during the journey. Then we started to, you know, cap start to capture the feedback as soon as user is planning to exit from the page. So that help that helped us in identifying what is the user expectation on that particular piece. Apart from that, whatever the changes, if we have made it, we used to man analyze it using, uh, by seeing the user, uh, videos, uh, basis that, uh, the identifications were done, uh, whether the changes has been made in customer convenience or not.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Incorporating heatmaps and user feedback from Content Square for design iterations and evaluating changes through user videos is a comprehensive UX strategy. How do you ensure that the technical integrations with these tools, such as Content Square and New Relic, are robust and do not significantly impact the performance of the applications they are monitoring?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So whatever the, uh, scripts that we were implementing for New Relic and ContentSquare, we had, you know, various tools, uh, that we use to identify the impact of these scripts. So first one was, uh, website tracking tools that were there, wherein as soon as we used to identify there are some extensions that we are putting in. Apart from that, we had our, uh, infosec team that used to identify if there is any, uh, extra script that are being, uh, put in place. 2nd. 3rd thing that we used to do is via New Relic, we used to identify the CLP, f, uh, FCP, LCP. Uh, these are some of the parameters that helped us in understanding why the largest component of the page is not loading, why first input delay is there. So all those, uh, core web vitals were used to were being, uh, monitored using, uh, New Relic for other type of different types of scripts that we are putting in. Apart from that, there are some extensions that were provided by Google, uh, that were used to see the, you know, page loading performance, uh, after implementing various scripts on the website.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Monitoring tools like New Relic for Core Web Vitals and using website tracking tools to assess the impact of third-party scripts is a solid approach. How do you approach the optimization of front-end and back-end integrations to ensure that the application remains responsive and efficient, especially in the context of the additional integrations you might have to manage for new features or services?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, John, I have not worked on direct implementations of these scripts. When I were given these these products, uh, these scripts are already integrated. So I don't have much knowledge about it.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: I understand the pre-existing nature of the integrations with monitoring and analytics tools. Given your experience with managing these tools in a monitoring capacity, how do you envision leveraging their data and insights to inform proactive decision-making in product management, particularly in identifying areas for enhancement or addressing potential performance bottlenecks in the application's integrations?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: So as I mentioned that we have some powerbear dashboards created for our business kpis or business numbers tracking. In parallel to that we have some dashboards created for our you know key performance of our backend and front end systems. Now there were certain around 10 to 12 API is that are being consumed in the applications? And in that we identified in the business decline out of the 30000 errors on basis. We saw that 20,000 errors are happening because we were prefilling some. Customer information. That was the mobile number that we are assumption that it would be user convenience. But when we see when we saw the data that 20,000 failures are happening because of the error called invalid slasher incorrect customer details and So that was one of the customer details that customer need to enter along with the some customer ID or other parameters whenever the bill was fetched. The customer was getting this error. So when we started to, you know, stop prefilling the mobile number and we gave a contact icon on click office. The contactless can be open in the mobile number can be seen. So once this this issue was identified by Me by analyzing the data that what is happening after speaking to the customer seeing the different videos that customers. Not checking the mobile number is considering that whatever the number is being populated is the correct one and is proceeding after entering the other customer parameter and the error was getting there. So after identifying this we stopped refilling the mobile number and that because of that we were able to reduce the 60% of the total errors that were happening. So this is one of the classic example of I use the data in order to improve the performance of the system.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Let's dive into your resume. I see you've had significant experience in social media and content strategy. Can you elaborate on a specific strategy you implemented at HongKong Yinta Tech that led to the 70% increase in brand awareness? What were the key components of this strategy and how did you measure its success?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, definitely, John. So first of all, I have around 6 years of experience in social media, and I have worked with major international companies like Garena, Hong Kong Intertek, ByteDance, and. In my last 6 years of experience, I have worked been working extensively in social media strategy, social media campaigns, influencer marketing, and all of branding with the company. So at Homegrown Intertech, I have increased in 70% of the revenue and overall visibility of the brand. So, uh, before that, I have, uh, led a team of 20 influencer marketing strategies in India and a strategy for promoting our furniture products to Instagram. So, uh, I have, um, made the complete SOP for working Amazon campaigns as well as influencer marketing campaigns. Uh, I led the team members and helped them in reaching out to the influencers through generated text, and as well as we have used AI and JetGPT in finding out, uh, the best influencers in furniture category. As our company, we majorly work on furniture and auto parts. We have, uh, reached out for the niche, uh, auto parts and furniture influencers, and this is how, uh, we have made this strategy. And apart from that, I have worked with my team, uh, especially with the Amazon teams from Shanghai, work with them in implementing Amazon campaigns for our brand, for branding and overall, uh, the value generation as well as, uh, increasing the overall visibility of Amazon page. So this is how, uh, I have helped the company in getting more revenue and helping them in, uh, getting, uh, more visibility and make them a strong brand among their competitors. Thank you.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's quite impressive. Given your experience with influencer marketing and AI tools for influencer selection, could you detail the criteria used to identify the most effective influencers for your campaigns? How did you measure the effectiveness of these criteria, and were there any adjustments made based on the campaign's performance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Definitely. So in our, uh, company, we use this, uh, international marketing tool called High Colliter. So using this tool, we check the whole engagement, estimated cost, and our collaboration time with the influencer. And based on that, we reached out to the influencers based on the engagement, their niche category, their followers, their audience, whether they are based in New Year or they are based in Europe. So we check all these things using this AI tool. And apart from that, we use their GPD, uh, for campaign drafting, for templates, for hashtags, as well as the descriptions which we send to the influencers. And this thing has actually helped us in getting more, uh, traction and made our work more easy and as well as increase our productivity. So this is how, uh, we, uh, have these are the techniques that we use for influencer marketing. And in influencer marketing, uh, like, I have around 6 years of experience in managing agencies as well. So we are collaborating with agencies as well for influencer, store promotion, and, uh, we also hire influencers through agencies as well. And regarding the negotiations, uh, we have the strategy. We, uh, look out to the influencer profile. Suppose that influencer is, uh, doing so much of home decor items. He is into funny second degree. So we look at the home and look at their, like, spaces and what kind of things. She she has an outdoor garden. So we will recommend her items ready to go out for garden, which she actually needs. So in that way, we, uh, have achieved significant bottle collaboration as well. We have the barter collaborations with, uh, in cancer called Kamna Hospital, and she's one of the top that, you know, transfer in US in DIY category. And we, uh, I looked at her, uh, like, backyard. She needed a fire table. She doesn't have a fire table at the time. So we shipped the fire table to her. And, uh, I had a negotiation with her. We had a call, and then I discussed that this this is the thing that we are, you know, planning to ship and how this thing will help her audience in being more engaged, and this is something she and her audience both will love. So she agreed to the barter collaboration. Uh, so this is how we reach out to influencers, check their needs, and, uh, we want them to closely we work with them closely and, uh, hold some strategy for beneficial for mutual beneficial of influencer as well as our brand. Apart from that, we are very cordial, and we always, uh, reply to the influencers for time and take care, uh, about their needs, and we'll make sure that the influencers will be posting, uh, the pending post on time as well. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to influencer selection and engagement strategy is quite comprehensive. Regarding the AI tool Hypetrack, how do you ensure the data accuracy and reliability of the engagement metrics provided by the tool, especially given that influencer engagement metrics can sometimes be inflated or manipulated?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so first of all, we checked, uh, the inferencing data and the engagement to high quality. So apart from that, we have our own CPM calculation method. In CPM, we prefer the greatest with a CPM of less than 15. CPM is like, uh, like, you know, the cost per 1,000, uh, views. The cost in USD per 1,000 views. So make sure that, uh, the CPA would influence us less than 15. And apart from that, we also check, uh, the engagement manually. So What we do is that we go to the Instructure profile and check out the top 5 videos, like, recent 5 videos, and check out the total engagement and total reach. Uh, like, suppose it has, uh, total, uh, you know, view of 1 lakh in the last 5 videos. And the average will be 20,000 for 1 video. And based on that, we will be calculating the CPM. And apart from that, we'll be checking if the influencer recently had a viral post or something. And suppose she had raised her recent temp post had 1,000,000. So based on that, we see the annual impression that we would reach. And apart from that, we check the comments as well because comments should be, uh, like, general if the, you know, the comments user the commenting user are actual or more. So we check that manually as well as ping then make sure that the inferencing we are collaborating with must be of high quality so that we can achieve our highest ROI as well as, uh, our CPM would be the least. Thank you.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you have a robust system for vetting influencers. Shifting focus to your data analysis skills, could you describe a scenario where you used data analysis to optimize a marketing campaign? What specific metrics did you focus on, and how did the insights from the data analysis drive your decision-making process?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. Definitely, John. So I as I mentioned, I led an Agile campaign to eat a home. So in that campaign, uh, there were around 50 products, and I was, uh, designing the landing page of the campaign, uh, with our product and design team. So I observed data on the sales data, uh, through data and analysis, this is I observed that there are 5 essence of the actual which I have the highest sales. And it was very evident that those XDRs are very competitive, and these are one of our best selling products. So the core of the campaign was generating the highest revenue. I have collaborated with the Amazon team and checked the item was abundant in store. So we, uh, on the front page, we made sure that through data analysis, we added most 5 x shares on the top of the campaign as the main highlight because this is the product that is currently worth selling. And we want to increase the visibility of 1 product because if we have a one very highly popular product, then brand awareness will increase as well. Also, our customer will see if the quality of brand is good, and then, uh, they will, uh, shift to the, uh, checking out or figuring out some new products for them as well. So we, uh, added those 2, 5 tables, uh, in the 2, 5 chairs in the campaign, uh, in the front page. And after that, uh, we added those new ASMs which we want to promote because, uh, it was, like, the Black Friday sale and the year was almost approaching. It was ending. So we added the our latest arrivals for 2024, the next year, uh, below those 2, 5 trending products so that we also promoted our best products, upcoming best products through, uh, the campaign. So the campaign had a very great sale. We had achieved 100 k USD plus sales in just a week, uh, for the ad sales. And it was a massive success for the team, and it was really, like, uh, a big massive success, uh, during the Black Friday sale for the company. Thank you.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Given the significant impact of your data-driven campaign on Amazon, could you elaborate on the process of selecting the initial five products for the campaign? How did your data analysis approach differentiate between high competition products and those with high potential for visibility and sales growth?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. I as I already mentioned, for, uh, the top five products, we have, uh, checked the sales data. And due to, uh, after data analysis, we added the top five best selling products on the sheet because the major most of the campaigns were increasing the sales, uh, during, uh, that quarter. So, uh, uh, we made around 100 k USD of sales, and around 70% of the sales were to the the top 5 x shares that were already wholesaling items, and 20% were the new items, uh, sales to generated for the new items that we were planning to promote in 20 24. There those are our latest arrivals. So by mixing those trending products and latest arrivals, we we will be very sure that, uh, there will be high visibility for those products. And also, we have promoted the new products to Android app during the same time. So that apart from these trending products, we can have some new trending products as well. And this campaign did really well our new items. We also would put you some of the sales for the new items as well, which we have just recently launched at the time. This is how we have, uh, increased the overall, uh, revenue as well as, uh, promoting the new products for our company, uh, through Amazon Champions. Thank you.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to balancing the promotion of established best-sellers with new arrivals is strategic. In terms of the new products introduced during the campaign, how did you define and measure their success? What metrics or benchmarks were used to evaluate whether a new product's introduction was considered successful, and did this feedback loop influence your future product selection for campaigns?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So our major goal was we want to sell at least 200 of those x s on of the new arrivals, uh, on our Amazon campaign. So during that time, uh, we had a sales of 20,000 USD, and we have, uh, scored around, uh, 1, uh, 1 50 of those HCS new HCS. So, see, the goal was, like, really on a higher side because for a new product getting 1, uh, 200 of sales is sometimes a bit challenging. But, uh, the management and team members, they were very, uh, uh, happy with the seeing the growth and because we did it through one campaign only. We didn't promote the ad sales, uh, you know, through some other methods through, uh, you know, some I'm gonna add as well. So that's why they, uh, were very happy with the performance. And later in the campaign after 1st week, we started promoting those new products to Amazonas as well. And we have seen a tremendous growth in the sales volume of the new products, and new product alone was considered successful at the time. This is our approach. And, uh, the metrics that we use for, um, the, uh, you know, for the improvement of, uh, our sales as well as the considering the success of our new launches is that this should be, uh, a decent clicks as well as because we want to make check the product pictures as well. If, you know, if their customer are coming to the landing page, it means that, uh, that they're clear on the product picture. It means that the pictures are already good. And because it's a new product, there were no not many reviews. So we have made sure the description is, like, really crisp, and we have highlighted the means from points of the chairs in the first, uh, you know, first paragraphs of the, um, description of the Amazon Edge chairs. So this is how, uh, we, uh, you know, promoted the chair. And for the success of the campaign, the goal was around 200 and at least 2,000 clicks and 200 of sales. Uh, this was the goal, and we have achieved around 5,000 clicks and around 150, uh, tiers in the selling volume. So that's, uh, how we have managed the campaign, and this is how we have described the success of the campaign for the new launches. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The focus on both sales volume and engagement metrics, such as clicks and landing page interactions, is insightful. How do you approach the challenge of establishing trust and credibility for new products, especially in the absence of many reviews, and how does this factor into your marketing and communication strategies for new product launches?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. For new products, our major goal is to promote them with the older products that are doing already well. And apart from that, we use Amazon ads as well, and we will influence the marketing majorly. We send these new products. We've given before launch. Suppose if the product is about to launch in March, so we will start shipping the product in January to the influencer and our vendor will post by February, February ending. Suppose if the, uh, loans date is, uh, March 1, then we will make sure the post are done by March 30. So if, uh, March February 28, this is our timeline. And then Spencer will tell to the their audience that, you know, this is a new product. I have received the limited edition, this new product from. And this is the newest HCL, and I found it really cool to make sure that our product is best in class and the inferences we see too are relevant, uh, for the product. And we before announcing the product, we make good, uh, content available even on the, uh, influencers side, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube as well. And also, we, uh, also have connection with the blog post as well, which we will write out about the new launches of our product, about our company. So we'll also promote those products on our those schedule as well. And apart from that, from the new products, we also use deal groups. There are so many deal groups we are in touch with. And also, there are so many deal websites in the US, flex details we use on them. We have partners with them, and we ship out we promote our new products, uh, on their website as well. And we provide special discount codes, uh, for our new launches and coupons so that customers can check those products initially. And, uh, you know, we can promote our products. And for the like, reviewing the note, uh, we send our product to influencers so that they can test the products. And if they really like the, you know, the product, then they will, you know, tell good things about the products on their platforms and people will be genuinely buying the products. And so this is the initial phase. Once we make sure the quality of products is really good, in the later phases, uh, the customer reviews come out to be posted because we make sure that the customer experience is our priority and the products will see follow the best quality to the to customers as well as to the influencer. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your comprehensive approach to launching new products, encompassing influencer engagement, content marketing, and strategic partnerships for reviews and promotions, is quite detailed. How do you plan to scale these initiatives for new product launches, especially considering the need to maintain high-quality and authentic engagement as volumes increase?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So yeah. Also, in that scenario, uh, we make sure that the quality of the products we are seeing in the influences are too close. And quality of the reviews are maintained, uh, by because we make sure that the customer reviews are genuine. So if there is some issues that our users are facing, so we contact those, ask them to share their, uh, numbers, their customer support as well, and we try to reach out to the customers and ask them, like, what are the issues they are facing. If they are facing some, you know, real issues, the product has arrived damaged, broken, and that's why they put a bad review on the MRO. So we asked them to, uh, we'll ask them for an replacement. We send the best product in replacement and make sure that other customer experience will not, uh, suffer. And after the, uh, right product has been signed, we are comfortable. Uh, if they are willing to change the review, they can change the review because we customer satisfaction are priority. And for scaling those campaigns, initially, we use in customer marketing, Amazon ads, and also our blog post and our deal website for promoting our products. We have like occasional campaigns, monthly campaigns on Amazon for our new arrivals. Like summer campaign, autumn campaign, uh, like season wise we have multiple campaigns and also we promote our product doing Black Friday sales as well. So this is our strategy for promoting the new products and scaling the campaigns for both products. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your emphasis on customer feedback and the proactive approach to addressing issues to enhance the overall customer experience and product quality is commendable. How do you envision leveraging technology, such as AI and data analytics, to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes, particularly in the realm of influencer management and customer engagement?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so our support team, they are using the AI based, uh, chat chat support. So, you know, we are implementing those AI tools in our chat support as well so that we can increase the efficiency, and one person can handle 2, 3, uh, queries with chat support in one time. You need to handle the AI. We are using AI for, uh, reverting to our customers. And apart from that, we are using AI for, uh, checking out the trends in the market. Also, checking out, uh, you know, everything related to the marketing domain, what are our competitors are doing, what kind of products they are working really well in the market. So this is how we are leveraging AI and data analysis in promoting our products and helping the company grow. Thank you.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Integrating AI into your customer support processes and market research initiatives is a strategic move. How do you ensure that the AI tools used for trend analysis and competitor research provide accurate and actionable insights, and what metrics do you use to measure the effectiveness of these AI applications in your decision-making processes?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. We do not rely on this one AI software. We get data from multiple AI sources. Uh, and apart from that, we have our own Amazon data as well. So we try to do the data analysis by keep making a report, keeping all the AI data as well as our internal Amazon data and our campaign data. So combining both these 3, uh, functional, uh, information, we make a strategy based on that, and based on that, we make the decision. We don't make this decision based on this one report. We figure out, uh, multiple reports and figure out what is right thing, uh, to do for our company, what is the brand most, and based on that, we create strategies using the AI tools as well as our internal data.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Diversifying your data sources for strategic decision-making, including both AI-driven insights and internal campaign data, is a robust approach. How do you see the role of AI evolving in the field of influencer marketing and content strategy, and what are some potential areas where you believe AI could have a significant impact on your current practices?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. No. AI has been evolving, like, really to a next level because there are already some softwares in that market for influencer marketing, which are AI based and which will help you in helping the influencer or getting influencer for the brand. So there are some AI tools which will, uh, if you go to the tools, and they will send automated emails about your interest to them. They will send automated, uh, Instagram messages to an AI, uh, using your the AI tool. So, uh, AI has been, uh, it has a, like, really big score in terms of marketing and campaigns, and it has been already seen through automatic AI generated newsletters. We are has been a tool for insider club, which helps influencers, uh, in, uh, connecting with their audience. Both I'm an influencer, and I have around 100 k followers. And, you know, I can have a separate community moving to AI tool. And every time I post a video, my all my followers who have subscribed to me, they will get a newsletter that, hi. This is, uh, influencer and she won't be as posted a video recently. You can click on the link below, and you can you can see, uh, the video using the link below. So this will help the influencer getting more leads and, you know, staying connected better with the audience. And if necessary, he doesn't have to do much. He just because the older message, everything will be generated. And below the, uh, agent, it will be some promotions as well as coupon codes and everything which can be used by its followers. And you know, also, uh, the followers, they can use the coupon code and do shopping. And if they're doing shopping, and the influencer, because they're using the influencer's link, we will be getting some additional remaining as well, uh, through AI, and it will be all tracked automatically by AI. He must have doesn't have to, uh, you know, do much or, uh, mandate his own links or something. It will be done by AI only. And it there'll be a dashboard in which influencer can see monthly income as well. So this is how AI has been changing the overall influencer marketing landscape. For influencer, it is helping influencer engineering more than we were saying, uh, more, uh, closely with their audiences, staying better in touch with them, and also generating more revenue as well as getting more reach. And for the companies, AI is helping, uh, gather companies, reaching the influencers, uh, by through and telling about the brands. And, uh, also, uh, AI will be, you know, minimizing the workload of the influencer marketing managers in the coming weeks as well. So this is how I believe AI is, uh, changing, uh, influencer marketing space. And using the AI, you can even do trends analysis. You can check what is the latest trends on multiple websites. And AI can even design a complete influencer marketing campaign for you. If you search about, uh, like, what kind of campaigns are currently in trend, and the AI will help you with that in figuring out the right campaign for your brand. You can even ask AI, this is my into this space, and we want to, uh, be the best in that space. And also, we want to, uh, design a campaign for our best part of the product. So can we select some campaigns? Here, we come up with, uh, one of, uh, the good ideas for the campaigns and later you can change the campaign according to what you need, but it will help you in brainstorming as well. So this is how are developing and then the marketing, and it is changing the landscape drastically.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Yes.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked extensively on brand communication and content strategy development. Can you walk me through a specific example of how you tailored messaging for a startup client, and what key factors you considered in that process?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: I worked for a startup called Peacefully, which helps individuals work through end of life necessities and\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging but important project. How did you approach the tone and style of the messaging for Peacefully, considering the sensitive nature of the services they provide?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. That was a that's a great question. And I, uh, what we did was we focused on being we looked around, first of all, competitors and saw how, uh, the other businesses that were in the same space spoke because, uh, one way that we recognize to stand out was have distinction in our brand voice. And we recognized that there was, uh, a lot of coldness in their tone. So we really worked on being as empathetic as possible, especially as you mentioned given the sensitive nature of the work. And so we looked at every communication on Instagram, etcetera, and made sure that it sounded like a human being, and that it also sounded like it was, um, even though we were providing necessary information, it was put in such a way that it was considered of where a person may be in their life in terms of potentially having just experienced a loss.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you put a lot of thought into that process. How did you measure the effectiveness of this new brand voice and messaging approach, particularly in terms of user engagement or feedback?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. We primarily looked at reviews and actually we interfaced a lot with our, uh, with our client base because, essentially, we were pretty small and we and the first couple people who are using the platform were, um, were essentially the first. So we were able to communicate directly with them. Some of them we actually knew personally. And we got a lot of important feedback about how the flow of information and questions was designed. Uh, we and we we, uh, of course, we were cautious of the fact that the sample size was not huge and but we did insist that people were unsparing in their criticism and then we factored in their feedback. And as time went on and we got more and more feedback, we were then able to test the changes that we were making against, uh, how people were feeling about the content.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a very hands-on and user-centric approach to feedback. Shifting focus a bit, I'd like to discuss your experience with SEO best practices. Can you describe a particularly challenging SEO problem you encountered at White Glove Financial and how you solved it?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Our goal at White Glove Financial was to write new content that would live inside of a platform and, uh, that we had built. And, uh, actually, we had acquired it. We had acquired it from another company, but then we were refining it for our needs. Uh, the company was, uh, the the goal of the company was for financial advisors to stay in touch with clients and recruit new business. And, uh, one of the ways to do that is basically to be introducing topics to people that were, um, that were sufficiently interesting and but would also lead to the conclusion that they could not master the subject themselves. They had to speak to a financial adviser. So what we did was we would have content that lived on our own platform, but we would share it on social media. And I would say the challenge with Facebook social media is, first of all, just from a back end standpoint, they are skeptical of platforms like ours, so we really had to be rigorous in conforming to their, um, their proprietary standards, um, because if you were too boring, uh, in your in any aspect of your content, it would not share that content widely, and it was really working against what we were trying to do for those financial advisors. So suffice to say that that that course that position required a crash course in Facebook SEO in particular, uh, now Meta, but we weren't really primarily using Instagram as much as we were trying to use Facebook because we recognized that that was more in line with where the customer base primarily was interacting on social media.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's interesting how you tailored the content to not only be engaging but also to drive a specific action. Given the challenges with Facebook's algorithm and standards, can you elaborate on some of the specific strategies or techniques you found most effective in ensuring your content was both engaging and compliant with their standards?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. I would say the way to do that within Facebook is that you're essentially just answering line by line as you probably know, um, both, uh, a subject title and then an article title. And so what you would do was, of course, you'd have the article title be something that would be outward facing and engaging. But then sort of the subject title would be, uh, basically a keyword rich thing that Facebook would recognize, um, as something that should be shared widely if someone was, uh, the type of person who was reading, for example, a lot of financial information on Facebook or even the Wall Street Journal, for example, we recognize. Those are the types of people who, um, were, you know, a big part of our demographic. Because the whole point of the financial advisor situation is that you are trying to get people to realize they don't know enough about a subject. And on that end, ultimately, um, while the content was while the goal of the content was this was definitely to be clear, It was also to emphasize the many pitfalls of trying to manage financial, uh, advice and, uh, management of one's portfolio by oneself. So the the goal was definitely not to be, um, muddy, but it was essentially to communicate the the the the crucial importance of getting these decisions right and how also how much of a relief it is when those decisions have been outsourced to someone who is ostensibly a professional because essentially, the financial advisor's pitch is that you don't, um, you know, you don't get get into a limousine with someone who's never driven before, and if you've never driven before yourself, you don't just get behind the wheel of a car and start driving. Um, and and ultimately that, um, while on a surface level, financial decisions are simple from the standpoint of just investing in index funds has has been the operative wisdom for 20 to 30 years. There are also so many decisions underneath, uh, retirement investing. For example, um, management of one's home and estate, education saving and spending, etcetera, um, and then the tax implications of all that that one should be thinking about. And and the goal was to emphasize how a holistic approach like that is so much more advantageous than just thinking, oh, I'm gonna buy um, whatever index fund at a regular price and blah blah blah, and that's all I need to do to be in a good situation financially.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to content framing and targeting is quite strategic. Shifting back to the technical side, could you explain how you approached the technical aspects of SEO, such as on-page optimization or site structure, to ensure the content you were creating for the financial advisors' platform was not only engaging but also highly discoverable by search engines?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Although I think I've kind of done that a few times, but I I guess basically, uh, when you're working, uh, in the back end in meta and you are it it in some part, this was a collaboration with with the, uh, people who had built the platform that we were then using at White Glove, which was, um, which, as I said, was proprietary, but would also allow financial advisors to not only share content via social media, but also keep track of their clients and prospects. It was basically one big dashboard. So, uh, but that the some of the decisions about how to optimize, uh, and get plugged in directly to Facebook and what they needed were being handled by the back end developing people who, uh, who were a separate team, and I was not necessarily a part of that team. They did ask me what what they would love to from me would and I was very simple in my response, which is just, hey. We need, um, we need stuff that looks professional, and we need stuff that looks like it's coming from the Wall Street Journal and other, uh, outlets that people trust because we just don't wanna look like, well, a very bad version of NerdWallet, for example. Um, so but but I will say that, uh, the most of the decisions for how to optimize, um, from a digital standpoint were, uh, were being handled by the back end development team because the goal was not to go viral on Facebook necessarily. The goal was to be much more, uh, personal and and informative and not really trying for fireworks, but really trying to simply just look professional and those that required, um, just building a system that talked to Facebook and answered all the questions and and looked like it was a professional outlet.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you had a strong focus on the user experience and the credibility of the content. Given your role in ensuring the content's professionalism and trustworthiness, how did you collaborate with the development team to maintain a balance between the visual and functional aspects of the platform, especially in terms of SEO considerations?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, the platform was I there's a little bit of a lack of overlap here because the SEO considerations were, um, you know, but they were basically internally handled. And then when it came but when it came to actually, uh, the design of the of the interface itself, um, that it was important that financial advisers would have an easy time navigating that because those were our direct clients. Uh, we weren't dealing with people who were trying to reach financial advisers. We were dealing with financial advisers and and those people can be quite conservative in in their approach. So I would say the the abundance of focus was placed on simply having an easy to use professional looking sort of Charles Schwabbe type interface that, uh, the type of people who were our direct clients, which as I mentioned, were very conservative, basically mid market and small market financial professionals who were just trying to grow their business from 5 to 7 to 9 to 13. Uh, they could be sharing content on Facebook that was not just, hey, I'm a financial advisor, come talk to me, but was professional looking, um, and also, um, and also content that they could trust and that and that emphasize the right content goals, which is let's just get people in the door and start having a conversation regardless of where they're at in life, and especially if they're at a turning point in life, like getting their first job, getting married, etcetera.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's interesting to see how the focus on user experience and trustworthiness extended to the platform's design and functionality. Given the conservative nature of the target audience, how did you approach the content strategy to ensure it resonated with financial advisors and helped them achieve their business growth goals?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: That's a great question. It was definitely something that we handled using, um, what what was happening at White Glove while I was there was we were leasing a a content platform, uh, that was widely used, um, and that we were paying a lot of money for, but that allowed advisers to share paywalled content, which was kind of the, uh, opportunity benefit that was being promoted to financial advisers and consequently to their clients, the type of people who, um, basically the incentive would be I'm gonna follow financial advisor x on Facebook because by doing so, I'll be able to read stuff on Forbes and Barron's, etcetera, uh, financial outlets that pay well their content. Bloomberg would be another example. Um, and we were getting away from that. We were we were having to do it ourselves. And so, um, so we we actually had an opportunity to spend 3 or 4 months surveying our current client base of financial advisors and asking them the type of content that they think would be good for their audience. Now we also recognize that they wouldn't necessarily be the best judges of that. Um, for example, uh, we got a lot of feedback about not including or even bothering to write anything about cryptocurrency. That's, you know, that's it was a type of thing that, um, that financial advisers were tired of hearing about, but at the same time, from a from a conversion standpoint in terms of bringing in new clients, it tested extremely highly after the fact for being the type of thing that that people were actually coming in the door and talking about. And that became particularly true as time went on and as we have now reached the point where there are Bitcoin ETFs and soon to be ether ETFs. This is the type of thing that, um, that at least the younger client base of financial advisers work with are definitely interested in diversifying their portfolio and especially given the state of the market right now, uh, in terms of being at an all time high. So, um, so to some degree, we were able to, uh, modulate and control the type of content that financial advisers would see and particularly the stuff that they wouldn't see, but it was also part of my job and our role as a company to convince them that the topics like LGBTQ would be another example that they might consider to be, um, outside of their purview and also potentially politically hazardous are also exactly the kind of things that a, get interest from people, and, b, may potentially grow a client base because, of course, with the younger generation, there are also more gay couples and things like that, and it's and it's financial advisers. Uh, once they use the platform would recognize that if they shared content about that, they could control who got to see it, um, and and and also who didn't get to see it so that they could be less conservative in their approach.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's fascinating to see how you navigated the balance between the financial advisors' preferences and the actual audience engagement data. Given the success of introducing topics like cryptocurrency and LGBTQ finance, how did you measure the impact of these new content areas on the financial advisors' client acquisition and retention?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: That was just something that we would reach out, uh, after 6 months, uh, of being on the platform. Actually, we did a small survey at 3 months and then a bigger one at 6 months. And, uh, in addition to the daily feedback that we would be getting through private channels, things like emails and chat, etcetera, that we were, uh, that we were keeping in contact with financial advisers. But we also did a concerted survey to see how these people were feeling about their content. And then, um, and, of course, also ask them to rate the effectiveness of certain content. There were also it's was not a huge client base of financial advisors, so it was the type of people that our account team regularly interface with. And I would say it was a priority of mine to, um, to route as many of those calls over to me as possible and or to be interacting with, uh, the 2 women who were in charge of the account base to hear the anecdotes about how certain content was performing and others not. Um, you know, the the there was never it was never surprised that backdoor Roth conversions were of interest to people, but, uh, it was it was, um, heartening to hear that, uh, social issues were driving as much of the conversation.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you had a comprehensive approach to gathering feedback and measuring the impact of the content strategy. Given the success of this approach, how did you use these insights to further refine the content strategy and potentially explore new areas of focus for the financial advisors' platform?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, I think you just answered the question. We we I would say it's not easy to say how we did that. Uh, that's just what we did. I mean, we we would, um, we would continue to write about basic issues, but, um, I think we recognize that what is a Roth IRA was not the kind of thing that would get the same feedback as something that was a little more incendiary, especially given that we were using social media. So I would say, um, I actually think from the beginning, we bit off a lot of of, uh, news verticals and\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you were able to identify and leverage the power of engaging and sometimes controversial topics to drive engagement and conversation. Given this shift in strategy, how did you ensure that the content remained informative and valuable to the audience, even when discussing more incendiary topics?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I wouldn't say we ever got 2 incendiary, but I would say that, uh, we we worked closely with a, uh, with a company that, um, uh, hired writers on someone's behalf when you were in charge of a team, and they turned out the the you were able to work with the same writer. You didn't get new ones all the time, so we were able to basically say, oh, this is our financial expert and they really get, uh, how we're writing, uh, how we're trying to write in a certain quasi journalistic tone, but but mostly on the informative side of things. And and then when we threw that person, um, a maybe more incendiary topic, and I don't think we ever did anything too incendiary, they knew to write it in our kind of brand voice because that was what that company in particular specialized in.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Hello. Hello.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great to have you here. I see from your resume that you've had experience with legal research using LexisNexis and Westlaw. Can you discuss a specific project where your research on these platforms was crucial to the outcome?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Platforms was crucial to the outcomes of the specific targets that I had to make.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a valuable experience. Could you elaborate on the process you used to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information you found on LexisNexis and Westlaw for these targets?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. So many of the projects that I had, for example, when I was writing a legal essay that was further published into my comment, a lot of the information that I had to use from were case studies legal briefs, different types of legal materials where having, like, this mess LexisNexis and Westlaw were essential, specifically in the form of finding codes, regulations, that type of information. And without it, I needed, to bolster, so kinda having Lexus nest eggs and Westlaw were essential to the publication of my article and a lot of the legal work that I have done since graduating law school from helping draft certain contracts from writing different memos. So it's been an important component in learning how to use the powerful systems.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've integrated these research tools effectively into your work. Shifting focus a bit, could you describe a particularly challenging aspect of using Zotero for organizing and managing your research materials, and how you overcame it?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. So specifically with Zotero, using it as, like, a a a tracker of a lot of my sources for different citations, things like that. It was the beginning, the biggest challenge was just learning how to use the software and then implementing it correctly within my research category or a collection of sources that I could input into whatever work product I was creating. For example, writing a legal research article incorporating the sources correctly, and the formatting of all of that, kinda more of the back end stuff. But overall, I was able to become pretty proficient with Zotero.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear how you've adapted to using Zotero effectively. Now, moving on to your experience at Small Business Utility Advocates, could you detail a specific instance where the policy recommendations you drafted led to a tangible change in regulatory procedures?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Absolutely. So one of the key functions that I have in this position is, reviewing different regulations that are kind of put out by the California Public Utilities Commission. And then through research, through different means of using, primary sources, secondary sources, and tertiary sources. What we do is kind of think about how this is gonna affect small businesses within primarily California, but more specifically within San Francisco area. In the Bay Area. And, one of the primary key results that I've been able to see through my work is, California is implementing a new, kind of regulatory rule making authority where they're looking for public comment and feedback, and I'm working on that and using the tertiary secondary sources, I've been able to, draft recommendations of how small business utility advocates should comment to the administrative law judge to make sure our clients, small businesses within the Bay Area, are adequately represented. And in doing so, they've been able to incorporate some of that feedback into the draft rule making. And though it's not published, a lot of the suggestions I've made have been kind of instituted and implemented within the draft rule making that will be for the proposed later\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your work on influencing regulatory procedures is quite impactful. Shifting focus back to your legal research skills, how do you approach the process of synthesizing information from a variety of sources to form a cohesive argument or recommendation, and could you provide an example of this in practice?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. I can. So one of the primary ways that I think about collecting and collating large amounts of information resources is you know, tracking that information, making sure I know my question, making sure I know my project, and then kinda annotating when I need to different avenues for collecting that information. So making sure I know within these 6 different rule making authorities or within these 6 different procedures, I can quickly kind of format, understand, annotate, I have an idea of where that information is, and then I'm able to kind of incorporate that within whatever writing component I might have. For example, I'm drafting a memo, I have all my sources within the document. I have my central questions, and then I can kind of start from a more broader point of view. And then as I write kind of narrow the question and within scope. So I've been able to do that through legal memos. Through my comments publication, through when I was a contract drafting attorney within the transactional world, a lot of that was germane going through different contracts to incorporate the necessary language within that contract. It was a key component of what I did, and how I was able to create legal effective work, and that was you know, making sure I had my sources, understanding the broader questions and themes. And then as I write, become more specific, using those sources and the question that I had in mind to answer for a client.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to managing and utilizing sources for different legal contexts is quite thorough. Now, I'd like to delve into the technical skills you've listed on your application. Could you explain a complex feature or function within Microsoft Office Suite that you've utilized in a professional setting, and the specific benefits it provided in that context?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So within Word, understanding the macro programs. So the formatting features, the functions, being able to use word on a high level is more than just being able to write text within the document. It's it's understanding how to quickly and efficient be organized documents, to make it appear nicer and more organized. And that goes from formatting 80 page papers using citations, all the robust functions within Word. But this also extends to PowerPoint, for example, understanding a lot of the macro features in PowerPoint to create a adequate presentation where it's organized You have your notes. You have the presentation. It's not too cluttered or clogged. And while I have good working knowledge of Excel, well, it is not close to the what I think the powers and capabilities are of itself, but I'm much more proficient within PowerPoint and within Word. And specifically within Word, making sure I know how to format organize documents, and all of the, powerful macro feed functions within that.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your use of macros in Word and PowerPoint is indeed a high-level application of those tools. Given your experience with legal research and the tools you've mentioned, how do you see the role of AI and machine learning evolving in the field of legal research, and what steps do you think should be taken to ensure the ethical use of AI in this context?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: I think it is absolutely part and parcel of legal research and kind of the incorporation of AI within legal research is super important. It's part and parcel to it. I see them kind of blending together and enhancing as a lawyer. As an attorney, the powers and functions and capabilities of my legal research. So it shouldn't be something that's shunned or something that shouldn't be used. It should be used to augment the capabilities of an attorney. So I think within the form of legal research, there's boundless capacity for it to be kind of incorporated, and I kinda wanna be on the edge of that because I think it's super important. For example, you know, if I'm researching, a case law, I can do a lot of my case law reading and review. However, that, you know, that's time consuming if I am able to use AI to more accurately track the cases that I need to use for regulatory compliance within a specific circuit within a specific district that's great. But if I'm able to draw more cases, with using AI, that's even better, and I think it'll help strengthen attorneys' legal research and writing capabilities.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given your perspective on the integration of AI in legal research, how do you think the current tools like LexisNexis and Westlaw could be enhanced with AI to provide even more value to legal professionals, and what specific features would you like to see in such an enhanced tool?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I think it can be more accurate in the sense of instead of giving you so many cases, they can give you less cases, more specific to the functions of what's happening. For example, if I type in energy regulation, within the Northern District of California, it'll pull up many different cases, some that are not germane But if you can classify the cases further, you know, if I'm looking for something within, electrical compliance instead of pulling up cases just related to energy compliance. They can pull up cases that are associated with electrical compliance and EV charging. Or it can pull up cases that, are tangentially related to that. So I think the biggest thing in AI is ensuring the accuracy and train of thought versus accuracy within word recognition, whereas the word electric or energy and it pulls up that case as opposed to understanding a deeper idea of what the case is about to incorporate that into the research algorithm would be super important.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your insights into the potential for AI to improve the specificity and relevance of search results in legal research are quite valuable. Shifting back to your experience with transactional law and due diligence, could you explain a particularly challenging aspect of due diligence in the context of Mergers and Acquisitions that you've encountered, and how you addressed it?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Absolutely. One of the most significant challenges is just ensuring that you've reviewed all of the relevant paperwork, documents, understanding if there's any title commitments or title issues within a merger and an acquisition. When you're, you know, working on an m and a case, for example, making sure there's not a section where within one of previous contracts that they have to get approval, and and it's just a lot of it's understanding the the meta analysis and kind of the the meta ideas and previous iterations of contracts, not just the current version you're working for. So for example, if you're working for a current entity, and that current entity was owned by 3 others understanding those contracts and the provisions that are still operable into the current contract and understanding who you need to get approval from, understanding the different contract components that kind of inhibit certain entity requirements if there's a voter shareholder or there's, different terms or ideas that are used the previous iterations of contracts, making sure they follow the same streamline of thought. Also, an an m and a is just working with, opposing counsel and understanding that you don't want to inhibit a relationship, but you also wanna represent the clients in the best of your ability. Understanding what to give up and what to give opposing counsel. In terms of drafting an adequate contract that, you know, makes both parties happy. So I'd say the 2 biggest challenges are understanding the previous contract iterations when you're doing due diligence to make sure you're crossing your t's and dotting your i's, making sure a lot of the work is, you know, legal germane and also adhering to previous contracts. So it's not opening up the client to any liability, but also working with your current client to make sure that they are not you know, giving too much of it in their interest.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your explanation of the challenges in due diligence for Mergers and Acquisitions is quite detailed. Now, considering your experience with contract drafting, how do you approach the task of ensuring that the language in a contract is both legally sound and clearly understood by all parties involved, and could you provide an example of a strategy you've used to achieve this balance?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Certainly. So one of the most important things within contract drafting is just ensuring brevity and conciseness. And know, there's accuracy within precision. So a lot of contract draft strategy that I use is taking a template contract, understanding what The main point of contention and the goal is ensuring that you're writing using specific words within shorter sentences that convey that thought and idea. There's no need for an 80 page contract as something could be done in 10. Understanding that all the key provisions are in there, and they're adequately addressed to the point. So I think the best contract drafting strategy is to be sure, precise with brevity. So that is one of the primary things within my contract drafting strategies.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your focus on brevity and precision in contract drafting is a valuable approach. Now, considering your experience with regulatory procedures, how do you stay updated on the changes in regulations, and could you describe a specific tool or method you use to ensure you're aware of these changes in a timely manner?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. It's a lot. It's through AI AI systems that send me news blast letters. I keep updated through LexisNexis through Westlaw. And within regulatory compliance where it's sending me different issues, day to day ideas, and changes within case law. And that's the primary tool I use, but also through the work that I do, a lot of it is updated daily. So I'm reading new rule making ideas. New public comments, kind of ideas like that. So I would say the way I say updated is through adequate information that's through news blast, through my work, just kind of ensuring that I'm I'm staying up to date with the regulations that are coming through. And the regulatory compliance ideas that are coming through through newsletters and through my work.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you have a comprehensive approach to staying updated on regulatory changes. Shifting back to your experience with legal research, how do you evaluate the credibility of sources, especially in emerging areas of law, and could you provide an example of a strategy you've used to ensure the reliability of such sources?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So ensuring the credibility of sources can come through. Several different ways. One of the primary ways that I look at is it's through you know, if we're looking at sources through primary means, ensuring that this study was conducted adequately, ensuring that it's being used in the appropriate manner. It doesn't wanna be know, kind of some nebulous idea, but is it actually stating an idea in our opinion? Then kinda taking a step back from that, has this source been used in other components? Like, if it's being used in legal cases, if it's an expert witness, then it's gonna attach more credibility to that idea. But even diving more into the background of that idea, I think, is important. In establishing the credibility of a source. But if it's just kind of more of a writing source, you gotta be careful with it. You gotta under you know, you gotta trust that if it's coming through a newspaper article, you gotta research the idea, the the journalist making sure that it's intellectually sound. So you know, if it's used in the legal context, it gives you more leeway as opposed to something that you just find on the Internet that's the source. So in assessing credibility, you gotta be you gotta be discriminatory in the way that you use it, understanding the ins and outs, the intellectual ideas, and going back to the root of it to really make sure it's credible at the end of the day.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to evaluating the credibility of sources, especially in the legal context, is quite thorough. Now, considering your experience with drafting expert testimony, how do you ensure that the complex legal concepts are presented in a clear and compelling manner, and could you describe a specific technique or tool you've used to achieve this clarity and persuasiveness?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So going back to making sure you understand the idea of you gotta understand the broader idea of what you're drafting in the persuasive brief. For example, I used some draft expert testimony for water rights in Louisiana, and I would talk with the scientific experts that were way above my expertise, but I had to incorporate you know, our legal positioning with their super dense scientific terms and ideologies. So it's making sure I understand understand what our key position is. Understanding what they're saying, understanding the nexus between what they're saying and that correlates to our position, stripping away the extraneous information that they provide, to help narrowly focus in within our legal goals and that's kind of the best way to do it. It's to understand the idea of what we have, you know, the broad issue, the idea, the specific component of what we need, and finding the information within an expert witness that scientific and kinda tying that into our very specific legal goal. And that's kind of the best strategy that I've been able to use.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

I can.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience as an Assistant Professor. You mentioned teaching C++, Java, Swift, and Web Technologies. Can you elaborate on how you designed your curriculum to incorporate these languages and how you ensured that it met the needs of students with varying levels of programming experience?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, I have extensive experience of teaching programming courses, c plus plus, Java, web technologies, software design and architecture. Uh, first of all, the coding background is very important. I want to make sure by by assigning different assignments and projects and, um, uh, so so that they can work together collaboratively. And, uh, at the same time, during the assessments, uh, I judge on the basis of their personal performance, what you have performed in that project in order to make sure that, uh, each person is trying to learn. And, uh, when when I feel that during the assessment that someone has not got good exposure for this course, definitely, uh, it's difficult for me to to pass him from that course.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach. How do you assess individual contributions to group projects, especially in a programming context, and ensure that each student is indeed learning and actively participating in the project, given the potential for uneven workload distribution in such settings?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Um, because it's a practice, um, uh, whenever we want to, uh, do some some some interviews in some in some, uh, big tech companies, normally, they assess on the basis of that what is the whole project is and what is your contribution is. So on the individual basis, I ask from some persons, uh, from the team, uh, on the individual assessment. Please tell me about the overall idea of the project, then tell me about his contribution. And then I did give up his all the details, what he has done. Sometimes, um, uh, the group people says that we have done all this together. So this is a this is a this is a very negative impression of on come on me because, um, I feel that only 1 person or 2 person is doing work, and all other person are, uh, sitting on the back back seat of the of the car. They are not driving that project.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you place a strong emphasis on individual accountability and contribution, which is crucial for preparing students for the industry. Shifting focus to your research on wavelet-based video codecs, could you explain how the findings from your research have practical applications in the field of video compression, especially in terms of efficiency and quality?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Okay. Uh, I have worked on the Wavelet based video codec. Um, and the quality was quite good during the research, but, uh, the issue was that it was not, um, uh, real time. So I have worked to improve the efficiency of the project, And, um, uh, I have, um, specifically, uh, in the video coders, the motion estimation module is considered to be the more, uh, computationally extent extensive. So I have worked on it because it was hierarchical, and it was takes a lot of computation power. I have studied all the code and has shifted and changed this the the existing algorithm with the 3 d artist, 3 d discursive search algorithm, and I find very fruitful results and very good efficiency. Yes. I have worked that, um, project, um, on academic basis, and I published 2 research papers and one good chapter. Uh, for the practical point of view, uh, it was very good. I had the plan to work on it, uh, to to to make a product on this video codec. But, unfortunately, I was not able to work on it and make it practical.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: The optimization of the Motion estimation module sounds intriguing. In transitioning from an academic project to a practical application, what specific challenges did you encounter, and how did you approach solving them, especially in terms of real-time processing constraints?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, whenever we work on the industry, uh, the basic requirement is that, during the research, we we make some fruitful results and share our contributions with the academic community. When we go for the industry, there are a lot of other skills we will have to manage. Uh, first thing is that we will have to manage a project very, uh, in the from the project project management perspective. And, um, we will have to add the team, make accountable their team, uh, put work in the form of agile methodology, uh, setting up the sprints, And I look assign task to each and every person and make them accountable so that we will be able to to release that, um, the product incrementally to the client. So challenges are lot, and, uh, specifically, we are working on the on the project, uh, which definitely will be practical, which will be used by the users. And so the quality is also considered to be the important. All the things are, uh, taking into consideration, uh, because, um, uh, it's it's important for the quality, and we will make the county builder and and manage the project properly. Then we will be able to ensure that we will be deliver the project and quality very well and in time.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your insight into the transition from academia to industry is valuable. Given your experience with project management and the emphasis on quality, how do you see these principles translating back to your teaching methodology, especially in terms of preparing students for the practical demands of software development and project management in the industry?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. During the, uh, courses, we are given the, uh, assign the projects to the students and try to uh, implement the that specific methodologies just like we will have to put up the project on the GitHub. We use normally, uh, the Trello, uh, give the students the exposure of the control systems like GitHub, SPN. Give the students about the, uh, dependency management tools just like m b m, NPM, and so on so that they will be prepared for the industry during their academic projects. But, unfortunately, because of the time constraints and, um, uh, limitation of the academic project and lot of things we will have to teach, We give us a limited exposure to the students because when we work on the practical leave, uh, in the industry, We normally work on the scalable problems, and the projects are grown incrementally and evolve eventually. So, um, that given that exposure to the students, uh, I am working on the on the FIP project, um, final year projects to the students. And that there are teams for around 4 to 6 peoples on the project, and I have started working incrementally. I mean to say, I have given started working on a project, and I have given that pro pro project to one of the FIP students when they completed their term. I have added a new group, trained them, and then added more features on it. And in this way, I have started evolving that product, and that is very valuable because, um, the students are getting exposure.

Normally, uh, when I started teaching the software design and architecture course, I first give the students a, uh, GSP assignments in the Java. It's it's an old fashioned assignment. There are a lot of, uh, libraries they will have to set up. And then I will change that assignment, uh, to this lab to to add m v n Maven, uh, this project. This is a dependency management tool. And because of that, I I say that please tell me your your findings and what above and adding dependence management tool has made your life, how easy the the the real your life will be. And other than that, um, uh, putting up the code on the Trello and GitHub, normally, uh, I give them the exposure during the during the lectures. But, uh, try to I I have tried, um, uh, but this exposure is considered to be very important, and I also judge the students through as well. What their understanding is, why we have used these tools, and why, uh, this is a requirement of industry, uh, because the these tools are quite mature, and it's these are very, very valuable tools, and they make, uh, the, uh, developers life, uh, very, uh, very, uh, effective and, uh, make the home based job, remote jobs, around the world, uh, in in because of their success.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: I appreciate your approach to integrating real-world tools and methodologies. How do you ensure that, in addition to becoming proficient with these tools, students also develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary to adapt to new technologies and tools they may encounter in their careers?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. Normally, uh, I emphasize students to to work on, uh, their critical thinking skills and problems calling skills, uh, extensively. I encourage students, uh, to set up their accounts on LeetCode and start working problems on that. Just like I have started working on the codes of software construction in Java, and today was my first lab, and I have given them the task from the lead code, uh, for for 3 4 problems to from lead code to solve them and then and then make make sure that it should be exposure of problem solving data structures, algorithms, and at at the same time, they are also able to get exposure of, uh, unit testing framework as well because working on the lead code sometime when we we we submit the problem, the hidden test cases are running. And if they all passed, the problem will be accepted.

And, uh, definitely, AI has a lot of good, uh, insights and lot of good, um, uh, problems calling, solving challenges, so they provide the solution. And, definitely, uh, some students are also interested for working on AI based projects. And sometimes we are considering the FIP projects, uh, to to assign to the students. We are also thinking about how can we integrate AI in these products.

Just like, um, I am working on the problem of EduSist. It's a education testing platform. I have started working on it for a, uh, university, uh, test management system just like SAT GRE. In in here in Pakistan, different universities after, uh, 12th grade take entrance exams before, uh, considering the students to get admission in in the university. So I have starting working. I have starting working on that and just adding multiple share trial question in the platform. A lot of other features are there. I will not be going to do a detail. Then I will, uh, enhance this project. Uh, then I have decided that, um, uh, this is a limited scope for the, uh, interest exam students. I should have to duplicate it from grade 1 to grade 12 students. So why you will have to add enhance the, uh, uh, evolve the back end infrastructure. Then I will come to the the front end that has been implemented in next years. Then if I have this decided to add more types of questions on the front end so that I will have to provide the facility to them, the teachers, and students. They will be able to, um, attempt the exams, uh, just like they are. They they attempt the exams in their one one to 12 years, uh, exams. So, um, there are different type of questions there just like multiple choice, multiple response, true false, yes, no, short questions, and long questions. When I come to the short or long questions, um, I I I have considering that here I will have to add that modules where students have to type their answer, and, uh, my my system will judge what his, uh, his score will be. And just like if the question is of 10 marks and if a student has written up every, uh, question, my system should have to date automatically, uh, 5 marks to that per student. So considering that approach, I have come an idea that I will have to add AI module. I will have to, uh, add, train the model. And, uh, on the basis of the model training, my system will judge all type of questions of multiple choice or multiple response question that will be judged, uh, by adding that modules separately. But for the for the short and long questions, that will be the critical questions. My system will will will will evaluate that questions automatically without involvement of the person or the teacher. So that is the next phase. I mean to say, while thinking on the product and thinking deeply, we can add different different, um, uh, approaches and different, um, uh, new features in that. And apart from that, we are also thinking about how can we evolve that product where, uh, AI comes into play. And, uh, I I feel that this is one of the important feature, uh, which will be one of the selling best selling point for this product.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your project on the University test management system sounds quite innovative. How do you plan to approach the training of the AI model that will evaluate the students' responses to the short and long answer questions? What considerations will be given to ensure the model's accuracy and fairness in evaluation, and how do you intend to involve students in this AI development process to help them understand the complexities of AI implementation and its real-world impact on education assessment systems?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Okay. Uh, I have different considerations, uh, right now. Uh, first of all, uh, I will also see, uh, the existing open source softwares which are available and evaluating that. I am seeing that which companies are working and, uh, on what feature they are working and what their innovation is. I am also considering the chair GPT. How can I use exploit the power of the chair GPT to evaluate the, uh, this, uh, to evaluate this process of the how what what is accuracy of the g r g p t? And I have also the considering the, uh, existing research which has done in this area. Uh, what the research has done, what are the findings of the people list, and, uh, how can I improve in that? So I have make a plan. There are 2 approaches which I am considering that, uh, uh, right now. One is, uh, for the model training, and, uh, on the basis of that, I will find the accuracy of that. And second, uh, that can be the, uh, a reboot where I will have to set up some rubrics. On on the basis of the rubrics, my system will evaluate, um, uh, that specific, uh, answer which our students has given. So there are the different approaches which I am considering that, and, uh, I think so. Uh, this is one of the challenging and innovative problem, and, uh, definitely, while working on it and getting results and, uh, by seeing the existing research, I I consider to be I am very hopeful that I will be able to come with some innovative solution for that.\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yeah. Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in web development with extensive experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you worked on at the stealth startup and how you leveraged your skills in Express.js and Node.js to overcome that challenge?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So, basically, uh, one of the challenges that we faced was, uh, uh, the API and the Chrome API Chrome performances. Okay? Um, so we were using Note, Express, and Prisma, uh, for our APIs. And, basically, we were using Prisma's native API And, also, you know, the code that was written preexisting was not very efficient. So, basically, I took up upon myself, uh, uh, the job of improving API performance as well as ground performance. So in this, I basically went through the code, understood the logic, okay, and made worked on making the database queries more efficient. Uh, in that effort, I also converted some of the, uh, like, Prisma queries to native queries because they would consume less resources. And, also, uh, in terms of response times, it was much faster. Uh, also, with the cron jobs, some of the cron jobs, which should ideally have taken 5 to 10 minutes, they were taking close to half an hour. So I, again again, went through those cron jobs. Okay. Did somewhat similar. Okay. You may try to minimize the number of database hits. Uh, and, also, one thing that I really implemented was parallelization. Okay. So, like, let's say we have 10 tasks. The cron job was doing one task, then another task, then the 3rd task, while these tasks were independent of each other. So I implemented parallelization so that they could work in batches of, let's say, a value k. So that would automatically reduce the ground timings as such. Apart from that, I also worked on some critical workflows. So, like, uh, one without revealing too much. So, like, I worked on how to charge customers, okay, once they swipe, uh, how once they use our products and, like, on discounts and so and, like, how much the discount would be and how much would be deducted from the wallet. So these are some of the challenging things that I implemented at the stealth starter. Yeah. That's that's my answer. That's quite an\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's quite an impressive approach to performance optimization, especially with the use of native queries and parallelization for cron jobs. Given your experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, can you discuss a scenario where you had to make a decision between using a SQL database like Postgres and a NoSQL database like MongoDB for a feature you were implementing, and what factors influenced your choice?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Actually have to make any such a decision. So wherever I went, the standard was always to use SQL. Uh, Most of my NoSQL experience has been personal. And, uh, but for me, one good thing was whichever whatever feature I was implementing or whatever project I was working on, my needs were served adequately with SQL. Okay? So as such, I didn't in a professional capacity, I never had to, you know, make the choice because, let's say, the standard was already defined. Let's say the choice was already made for me, so I had to work within that constraint. But, uh, I never had any problem fitting my needs into an into the sequencing. Thing. So, yeah, that's my answer. Understood.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, it sounds like you've been able to work effectively within the constraints of the projects you've been involved in. Shifting focus to your front-end experience, you've mentioned proficiency in React and Redux. Can you walk me through how you've used Redux in a past project to manage the state of a complex application, and perhaps touch on any challenges you faced with state management and how you addressed them?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So I like I said I have worked on Redux. I've also worked on a another tool called mobix. But yeah, so Redux is where basically for me Redux is always a no-brainer because like it makes everything very centralized. Okay, obviously, there is a lot of boilerplate code to write but one good thing after you write the boilerplate for the standard is already set. So initially first time you're setting up Redux. It's a you know, it's a little bit of an effort because you have to write the boilerplate code and you have to set it up. But once you start using it, the best advantage that Redux gives is is how easy it makes things to debug so you can pinpoint certain actions. So like if you have a bug you can pinpoint a certain action where that occurred. Okay, and you can look at the code there. Okay, so that makes it you know that narrows down your, you know source to of errors. Significantly so you know where exactly there might be an issue in terms of your code. So yeah in terms of how I have set it up. Yeah, I mean like see just following the documentation and like I have worked with Redux and angular as well. So I thought and I use that reduction makes pretty well. So I just followed up the documentation set up the standard at that and like after that the team followed and I also followed so like the after that it was pretty simple to you know, Follow what was already written by me? So yeah. That's that's my answer. Yeah.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you value the predictability and ease of debugging that Redux offers, and your approach to setting up standards for the team to follow is commendable. Given your experience with both Redux and MobX, can you compare a situation where you might choose one over the other? What are the trade-offs you consider when deciding between these state management solutions?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So, uh, when I would choose Redux? So in 90% of the cases, I would use Redux just because of predictability. And, like, one very good thing that one difference major difference between Redux and MobX is, like, when there is a state state change, Redux, every time it creates a new object. Okay? In MobX, what happens is your object is rewritten. Okay? So it's by reference. And this time and with, uh, with MobX, you know, uh, the reference has changed. So, like, the value at that reference has changed. But for Redux, every time a new object is created. So I would suggest Morbex if you like if you, you know, if you know what you are doing, if you are a skilled developer, right, you have worked enough with state management tools. And, you know, you have to set up a project pretty fast. Okay? Because MobX, you know, it significantly, uh, decreases your development time. And if you know if you are good with JavaScript, if you understand the basics of, you know, reference and all that, then MobX can, you know, MobX can really help you in terms of getting a project underway pretty fast and, you know, getting your MVP done pretty far. But I would still, you know, for a big project and where, you know, lots of people work and of different experience and different skill sets and different, you know, levels. So I would still go for Redux just because, you know, how easy it makes, uh, you know, debugging and development once the standard is set, once the initial boilerplate is written. Yeah. That's my answer. That's a very\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very insightful comparison, highlighting the immutability of state in Redux versus the mutable nature of MobX, and the implications for performance and development speed. Given your preference for Redux in larger team environments, can you describe a specific instance where the predictability of Redux helped you debug a particularly tricky issue in a team setting? How did you go about identifying and resolving the issue?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So, typically, like, I think this is something that we face, uh, face regularly. So, like, uh, let's say I I had a, you know, a search state and, basically, I was fetching some data from the server. And probably the data that I was getting, I had to, you know so there there are n examples. I can think this off on the top of my head. Okay? So I had to man, uh, you know, mutate the data in order to just get it into a structure that it could be shown in the UI. Okay? So, uh, obviously, I ran into some errors and, like, uh, the JavaScript, uh, code crashed. Now this was all in look in my local. So, basically, I saw the log up to where, uh, so what what you can do is in development mode, you can always set the logs to 2. That means in development mode, the Redux will log each and every action. So for me, it was pretty simple because, uh, I'm sorry. Very sorry for the interruption. So, uh, it sounds like you\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you were about to describe how you utilized Redux's development mode to log actions and identify where the issue was occurring. This is a great practice for debugging complex state interactions. Could you continue with how you used the logged actions to trace the problem, and what specific steps you took to resolve the issue once you had pinpointed the source of the error in the state management?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Once I saw the last log, uh, action, I knew that the problem lay somewhere there. So I went back and I checked the reducer code, and boom. I solved my issue. It was a pretty silly mistake. Just rectified the action, uh, rectified my code, and, yeah, boom. Uh, it's working fine after that. Yeah. That's that's my answer. It's great that you\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great that you were able to quickly identify and correct the issue once you narrowed it down to the reducer. Moving on to another aspect of your experience, you mentioned leading a team of developers at OYO. Can you discuss how you approached leadership in a technical context, particularly when it came to mentoring or guiding less experienced team members in the context of web development best practices or new technologies?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, so for me, I had to balance 2 things. Firstly, I was it was not just I was just mentoring. I was working on a, you know, a project also, which had pretty tight deadlines. So, basically, I could not be, you know, uh, having I I could not spend, like, 70 to 75 percent of my time in terms of, you know, educating everybody. So initially, I started off with a small team. So I was only 2 we were only 2 members who are working on the project. So for me, I started, you know, I started by, uh, helping out the other guy, okay, with whatever I knew till then. Some of the things were even new to me that we were implementing at that time. But whatever I was able to understand, I was able to impart to, uh, my partner, who was obviously 2, 3, uh, years junior to me. He had been in the space for 1 year already. He had 1 year experience. So once that was done, okay, uh, I started to delegate a little bit. Uh, it's not that I completely took off my, uh, hands from the team. So, like, slowly slowly, others also had to push their hands into web development. So many times, they didn't have a, you know, a starting round. Often, uh, what I would do in that case was, uh, I would take off some time. Let's say, uh, one and a half or 2 hour call, and I would put 2, 3 guys in. And I would start from the basics. Okay? Start from the very basics. So, like, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and slowly come over to React. Also, I would explain to them what is the perfect what is the, you know, good resource to follow, How you can, you know, um, build your base in terms of web development, which has HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or React, the the same one that we were using. Right? So and I encourage them to go through the material, come to me if they had any doubts, and utilize it. So slowly slowly I mean, like, they they had their task. They would get stuck. I would help them, and I also guide them to how to increase their knowledge in that. So slowly slowly, a team which had almost no front end experience apart from me, I could say after 6, 7 months, 5, 6 of the people were pretty decent in front end development, and 2, 3 were pretty good with React as well. So that was my approach. That's a very\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very hands-on and practical approach to leadership, focusing on both immediate problem-solving and long-term skill development. It's clear that you value building a strong foundation in the basics and then gradually introducing more complex concepts. Given your experience with React, how do you ensure that the team adheres to best practices in component design and reusability, and could you give an example of how you've enforced these practices in a past project?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So it's it's, you know, it's more of a how a person can think. Okay? So in the past, the people who have worked with me on specific react projects so let's say we have a design. Okay? Let's say we are developing a design. So I have with them I have sat with them, and I have, like, tried to impart in them some of my learning. So, like, you see this part. Okay? So this is a separate thing. So you can make it into a component. And, also, I also, uh, explained to them, like, what parts are reusable. Okay? So I explained to them what parts are reusable that can be reused and, like, what parts is like, what parts are a little independent of each other? So if, let's say, I have, uh, one part which has information about, let's say, a topic a, and I have another part about topic b. So separate them out. So that's how I mean, I imparted with them. I I think it's maybe a little bit more tougher to explain right now. But if I show you if there is a design in front of me and if I, you know, break down the design into different blocks and set this block, this can be broken into 2 components based on this block is showing this part, and this block is showing so once or twice, I have run with them. How can you basically break down your, uh, design into components? Okay? Apart from practices, see, it all came from me, so I laid down. So earlier, we were using class based components. I strongly, uh, you know, laid down that no more class based components. We have to switch to functional component, and we started using hooks as well. So this all started for me. I laid that down, and, also, I used to do a code review. After that, uh, the one who was who worked with me the longest, he started doing lot of the code reviews. But, you know, all the anything that was merged into the main branch would always, you know, go through a core review from me. So that is how I imposed the best development standards in terms of front end development in the in my team. Uh, Yeah. That's fine. It's great to hear.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you've been proactive in transitioning to functional components and hooks, and that you've established a strong code review process to maintain high standards. Your hands-on approach to breaking down designs into reusable components and your emphasis on mentorship through code reviews are excellent strategies for ensuring code quality and reusability. Given your experience with both class-based and functional components, can you share some insights on the performance differences you've observed between the two, and how you've communicated the benefits of functional components to your team?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Actually, uh, no. I haven't made a comparative study. I just moved along with, uh, moved along from function to class because, uh, from class to function. Sorry. My bad. Uh, because, like, uh, that was the next step in involvement. And, like, I read through the act. So, So, like, they always recommended it. Uh, in terms of what React said, so I did not I have not done this performance analysis. I can only say in basis of what I've read on the React official website. So functional components, you know, class components make the code a little bit bloated. The more bloated your code becomes, you know, the bigger bundles you send when you are finally deploying the website. The bigger bundles you send, the performance suffers. So that is one thing. With with function components. Your code the code that you are sending to the browser, it's smaller. Okay? And, basically, the smaller bundles you send, they're more performing to your website. So yeah. But I, on my on my own, have not done a comparative analysis of performance in terms of function and class based components. What I have what I'm saying to you is based on pure reading. Thank you. Yeah. That's my answer. I appreciate\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the performance comparison and your reliance on official documentation for best practices. It's clear that you value staying informed about the latest recommendations and are able to apply those principles to your work. Let's pivot slightly: considering your experience with both front-end and back-end technologies, how do you approach ensuring that the APIs you develop are secure, particularly when integrating payment systems like Stripe? Can you describe some of the security measures you've implemented in your past projects?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So, um, so one important thing is in terms of Stripe is, we view we implemented a token based authentication, okay, for our APIs. So, um, basically, we had a middleware, and it would basically check if the user is valid or not. And, also, we would refresh the token. Uh, I'm not I forgot the time, but, like, every I I'm if I'm right, it's 14 days. So we were ahead of, uh, you know, a refresh token mechanism also where every, uh, 14 days, we would, uh, expire the existing auth token. And, basically, the client needs to send a new refresh token. And, basically, when he asked for a new refresh token, then, you know, send a new refresh token as well. So, uh, we had this token rotation in place. Okay. And apart from that, in general, some of the things that we did was, uh, we reduced footprint and, uh, we used helmet. Uh, so we we use Helmet for, uh, you know, Helmet to snip off unsecured headers. And uh, yeah, these are all Implementing\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Implementing token-based authentication with a refresh mechanism is a solid strategy for maintaining API security, especially when dealing with sensitive operations like payments. The use of JWTs and implementing CORS and helmet are also key measures for securing web applications. Given your experience with these security practices, how do you stay updated with the latest security threats and best practices, and how do you ensure that your team is also well-informed and compliant with security standards when developing new features or maintaining existing systems?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So it's so this is something that is applicable to any topic. So like obviously as a software engineer work doesn't stop at what you do, you have to constantly keep yourself updated. Okay, nowadays, the information that is available on the Internet is quite a bit. So like there are a lot of good platforms where you get a lot of good Tech articles and there are a lot of platforms very good courses as well. So basically from time to time whenever I encounter something, okay and encounter something about security Etc. I definitely read it and I definitely forward it to my teammates. And yeah, if like anything that has to be implemented just goes through a small discussion with the teammates, but in general reading and staying up to date is how you know, we I stay up to date with you know, security measures and other there are a lot of good, you know create content creators out there. Who right now who have publishing newsletters every week who highlight such stuff there a lot of good YouTube videos a lot of good articles on platforms like medium that you know, that will help you keep up to date not just for security for any topic related to development as such.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a variety of projects involving front-end and back-end technologies. Can you walk me through how you typically decide which tasks to handle on the front end versus the back end of an application? And how does this decision-making process influence your approach to a new project?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: So, basically, uh, before starting any of my projects, I first, uh, go to the requirements. What are the requirements, uh, specified by the client side? Then after that, only I proceed, uh, I I proceed to, uh, uh, to decide which tech stack I should be selecting for this, uh, specific problem. And then only I go ahead after discussing it with uh, my other teammates and all.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a solid approach. When you consider the requirements and choose your stack, how do you ensure that the front-end and back-end technologies you select work well together, especially in a project with dynamic user interfaces? Can you give an example of how you've managed this integration in one of your projects?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So for integrating the projects, uh, usually, I I have expertise in JavaScript. So So for JavaScript, it it's pretty easy. Like, we for the front end, I I use React, and for back end, I use Node. Js. So since both of the both of these frameworks and runtime uses the same language, it's, uh, it makes it easier to, you know, integrate both of them together. So I have a lot of projects around this. Like, I have built a chat application where I also integrated Socket. Io, which basically uses the socket protocols who, like, for real time chat applications. And I integrated them, uh, like, for back end, I use Node. Js. And for front end, I use, uh, React only. So, yeah, this is how I integrate them.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given your experience with integrating Node.js on the backend and React on the frontend, how do you handle state management in large-scale applications, particularly with regard to the use of Redux toolkit or other state management solutions? Can you discuss a specific instance where you had to make a decision about how to manage state in a complex application?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Sure. So yeah. So for, like, state management, if we, like, uh, if if our user base is not big, like, for for example, if our code is not that complex, we are just building a small small scale application, then we should not go for Redux toolkit and all. React only React already provide us context API. So I've used context API too. But, like, if our code base is huge and there could be a lot of complexities, then only we should go for Redux because it it also has some of its own, uh, you you can say, like, boilerplate load code and complexity. So it's like, usually, uh, this is how we decide whether we should go for Redux Toolkit or not. So in one of my applications, I use Redux toolkit because, like, we have to manage state and all, and we want to avoid prop drilling. So prop drilling is basically a situation in React when we have to pass state down to the child components. And if there are multiple child components, then it makes it really difficult to pass down all all the data that we want to share with all other components. So at these places, we usually use Redux toolkit or, like, context API. So what happens is we basically we create a single store, uh, single point of contact where all the components can fetch their data or do whatever changes they want with the global state. So for handling global state, we use context API or Redux toolkit. That's how we use it.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: I appreciate the detailed explanation. When working with Redux toolkit, how do you ensure that your application's state remains normalized, especially when dealing with complex data structures? Can you describe any specific techniques or libraries you've used to achieve this?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: '], [\"Interviewer: Normalization of state in Redux can be challenging, especially with complex data. Have you encountered issues with state normalization in your projects, and if so, how have you addressed them? Additionally, are there any specific libraries or methodologies you've found helpful in maintaining normalized state within a Redux environment?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sorry. I'm not aware of this. Uh, I'm sorry.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's completely fine. It's a complex topic, and managing state in Redux is often an ongoing learning process for many developers. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you've worked with Docker for containerization. Can you explain how you've used Docker to containerize your applications, particularly in the context of a microservices architecture? What challenges have you faced with Docker and how did you overcome them?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So Docker is basically, uh, an application which we use to containerize our application. So the major use case of Docker is that we have a very big issue of that, like, the code is working on my machine. So this is how we overcome the situation. So what Docker does is, like, uh, whatever software or whatever operating system we require for 2 run application, we can package all those in the form of a Docker image. So docker image is basically a blueprint of how a container should be built or whatever, I mean, like softwares or operating system we require to run our application. So once we containerize our application so in microservice architecture, how it is used is, like, let's say we have different services. Like, for payment, we have different service. Like, for, uh, let's say, if I if you take an example of ecommerce application, we have a shopping cart that that could be a separate, uh, you can say, like, service authentication would be a separate service. So in order to, like, you know, to separate all these services, we containerize all these services in different docker containers. So, uh, the advantage of doing this thing is, like, first is these, uh, like, we can, like, you know, uh, we can separate our complexities of the of the code. Like, different teams can handle different services. So this is how, like, the the teamwork, you know, can be achieved. And the how Docker plays, uh, his role in this picture is we can use Docker containers. So basically, if any new user, let's say, new engineer joins our team, so we don't have to, like, specifically tell him that you and you need to install this operating system. You need to add the software, you and all of this. We can just give him the image, and he can create a new container for himself. And that's how he can, uh, start contributing to the project. So this is how doc uh, I mean, like, Docker has been containerizing the replication.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your explanation provides a clear understanding of how Docker is used for containerization, especially in a microservices architecture. Given the distributed nature of microservices, how do you approach service discovery and load balancing within your Dockerized environment? Have you utilized any specific tools or technologies to manage these aspects effectively?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Actually, I I I have not used any technologies for this, but I am I am aware of a technology that will specifically use with Docker, which which is known as Kubernetes. So Cuban Kubernetes is an orchestration tool to manage Docker containers, which, like, automates the process of load balancing and scaling, uh, and all these things for us. So I, uh, I have some basic understanding of Kubernetes only, but I haven't used it. So I'll be honest with it. Yeah.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your awareness of Kubernetes is spot on. Given your understanding of Kubernetes as an orchestration tool for Docker containers, how do you see its role in managing the complexities of a microservices architecture, especially in terms of ensuring high availability and scalability for individual services? Additionally, what aspects of Kubernetes would you be interested in exploring further to enhance your skills in container orchestration and management?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. Fine. So Kubernetes is basically, uh, an orchestration tool. So what is what does it mean is, like, once we have created multiple containers for different services of our application, we need something to, like, you know, manage all these things. We don't we don't want that every time we have to do all these things on our own. Like, if, uh, like, for example, Kubernetes provides us a feature known as fail safe. So if, like, some of our services goes down, it, uh, quickly generates, uh, another one so that our system our whole application don't go down. And it also, like, handles the, uh, like, let's say the things like load balancing and scaling also. So this is how, uh, Kubernetes helps us, uh, in managing our Docker containers. So I want to further explore Kubernetes. Uh, right now, I'm I have just started with it. So that's why I do I don't have the that much understanding of Kubernetes. The only thing I'd know is, like, it helps in orca in, like, you know, managing our docker containers and all these things. So I want to further explore, like, uh, there is one thing known as config plane, which is like the we can say, like, the brain of Kubernetes, which handles all these functions. Then there are ports and all all of these things. So I I have I don't have deep understanding of all these things, but I have I have, like, uh, you know, excited to learn more about all these things. So I'll be learning about them in future.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your interest in exploring Kubernetes further, particularly focusing on concepts like ConfigMap, is commendable. As you delve into Kubernetes, what resources or learning paths do you plan to utilize to deepen your understanding? Are there any specific projects or scenarios you'd like to work on to apply your Kubernetes knowledge practically?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?

Specifically, which resources or learning paths do you intend to use to enhance your understanding of Kubernetes? Additionally, are there any particular projects or practical scenarios you have in mind to apply your Kubernetes knowledge as you learn?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So the resources that I'm specifically focusing on is, like, uh, first, I I I go through, like, some tutorials on YouTube, like, a kind of crash course and, like, you know, then I, uh, first, I go through a crash crash course. Then I also go through some blogs and articles about Kubernetes to to get a deeper deeper understanding of it. Then, uh, the second thing that I do is, like, I, uh, I used to, like, search for any any any tutorial which, like, you know, also gives us hands on experience on how to, uh, do things in Kubernetes, how to, like, take advantage of Kubernetes to handle our docker containers. So I have some projects in mind where where, like, uh, I was thinking, like, to utilize these things. So, yeah, in future, I'll be doing that to enhance my knowledge on Kubernetes and Docker.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's a solid plan to start with YouTube tutorials, blogs, and hands-on tutorials for practical experience with Kubernetes.

And in terms of practical projects, what kind of applications or systems do you envision working on to apply your Kubernetes and Docker skills?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Sure. So, like, the like, before following any, uh, resource for enhancing my understanding of Kubernetes, What I focus on is, like, how deep they are going with the, uh, within a topic. So how so that's what I I can also get, like, a deeper understanding of their topics. So first thing is that. The second thing is, like, uh, what kind of language they are using. Uh, is the language is too complex for me to understand or not? If it's too complex, then I first try to go for some, like, you know, like, uh, some easier blocks where where I can get a, like, a basic idea before deep diving into the into these topics. So this is how I decide to, like, enhance my knowledge. Second thing, like, uh, I have some full stack projects, which I was, like, thinking of, like, implementing all these skills which I'm learning, like, Dockers and Kubernetes. Although, like, these projects might be small for me to, like, apply all these things, but I'll try to, like, find some videos or lectures where they where they have some already built built projects, which I can use also to gather information about Kubernetes and Docker and implement all these skills on that.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to evaluating learning resources based on depth of coverage and language accessibility is thoughtful.

Like, Docker plays a very big role in handling these, uh, these complex things. And Kubernetes in, uh, at top of it, like, helps in, like, uh, managing all these Docker containers. So the main, uh, main I I would say, like, the problem which, uh, Docker helps us to overcome is, like, uh, if we have a so every, like, here and then, uh, engineer will, like, you know, uh, there will be a new joining or or there will be someone who will be leaving our organization. There will be a new joining and all. So we don't want to want to, like, waste all the time in, like, setting up this or other device to run the application. Instead of that, we can, like, just directly give them Docker image, and you can create like, run this application in our docker as container where you don't need to, like, worry about anything else other than, like, working the specific application. What I mean is, like, installing other libraries, others for free other frameworks, other soft end services and all. You can directly, like, jump onto, uh, contributing to the application from the day 1. So that is how Docker helps us in that. And also, like, in scaling part, we can have different, uh, different services. Uh, I mean, like, microservices containerized in in Docker application, which helps us to keep them separate and connected to each other at the same time with the help of Docker network and all these features.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Yes. Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at SADA Systems. You mentioned specializing in AI/ML and data analytics with GCP. Can you describe a specific project where you had to optimize a machine learning model within a GCP environment, and what challenges you faced?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Thank you. So I work as Sarah as a senior lead AI engineer, and I lead the AML practices over there. The recent project in which, like, I kind of replaced their existing ML models with their Gen AI models is for the client, and they were and the client is based out of US, one of the largest networking industry client. So the the if I have to say about the use case, right, the use case is about, uh, like, they have a set of, uh, uh, different documents which they want to categorize. And to and there's a classic example of a document classification. For this, they have already trained multiple machine learning models, and those machine learning models are, like, has to be continuously retrained and deployed when continuing then to an endpoint. So with the help of Gen AI, we try to overcome the part of, like, retraining the machine learning model with the new sample data every time. Rather, here, we use a a hybrid approach, like a a combination of an NLP plus the Gen AI. Using the prompt engineering, we were able to successfully classify all the documents into a series of predefined categories and then reducing the overhead of, uh, like, the MLOps, existing MLOps, and then at the same time, uh, matching the efficiency or and as well as the accuracy of the documents which will be in the show. That's all.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a fascinating project. Given the hybrid approach you mentioned, incorporating both NLP and prompt engineering, how did you measure and ensure the model's accuracy and efficiency throughout the retraining and deployment process, especially considering the need for continuous learning with new sample data?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Correct. Correct. Correct. So one, uh, so I'll answer that in 2 parts. So first is in terms of, uh, like, for the new data. Right? So the one of the major advantage of using Gen AI based models is the language because it's been trained on the wide sense of, uh, data and across, like, so much of domain, and it has, like, close to 7,000,000 parameters and of which and when trained. So the scope of, like, introducing new data where, like, in the language can be completely new, but since but still the semantic meaning of the document could be the same as with respect to the old document. Right? So in that case, Jenny helped us to overcome the reducing, uh, overcome the challenge of new data. Secondly, in terms of, uh, like, comparing the metrics. Right? We had, like, certain metrics. Like, we came in for confusion metrics and as well as f one scores. So both, like, uh, we we had, like, an truth dataset of, like, a set of documents. We had close to 500 documents versus, like, this was the expected, and we were able to get, uh, an accuracy more than 85 percentage in both. Right? Like, in with respect to the old model as well as and with respect to the new model. And this is and this can be further improved because with Google's introduction of new model, like, 2 days back, the one point five pro, which has a huge contact size, this accuracy will definitely further increase.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Given your extensive experience with GCP, particularly in AI/ML, I'm curious about the infrastructure aspects of this project. How did you design the GCP infrastructure to support this AI solution, and what specific GCP tools or services did you find most critical in this context?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Perfect. Yeah. So, uh, the client had, uh, given us the documents in a drive folder. So what we did was, like, uh, copied all these, uh, documents into a Google Cloud Storage Bucket. So that storage bucket, uh, can is can be considered as an a data repository for us. From there, we built an pipeline such that that content so we took multiple approaches. One of the approaches was, like, to get extract the content with OCR and without OCR. If, let's say, we are going with with OCR, we go with the document AI and then extract the content, pass it to the Gemini, like, the Gen AI models slash Gemini, which is the Google's Gen AI model. And then, uh, at the same time, like, all this was deployed to an endpoint. So this endpoint, uh, we didn't you go for the vertex endpoint. We we went for the, uh, let me but we didn't go for the vertex endpoint. We went for the something called a cloud function. Okay? So in that the same time, the results was given to us, and then finally, results were being written to the big query. Okay? So that's the entire end to end process. Um, then, uh, another was without OCR approach. So without OCR, we completely went with a custom script where, like, we had in a storage triggered. The moment a file was been dumped with GCS, it gets triggered in that cloud function gets triggered and ultimately tries to the the output of it.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to handling the documents, including the use of OCR and custom scripts, sounds quite comprehensive. Could you elaborate on the decision to use Cloud Functions for the model deployment endpoint instead of Vertex AI, particularly in terms of scalability and management of the deployed models?  \\n', \"Interviewee: The scope of the project was actually POC. So and the client client was very sensitive about the cost. So if you are using the vertex endpoints and all, right, so it will incur higher cost, and the client wasn't very focused on scaling and managing fully. So since Cloud Functions also offers a pretty decent scaling as well as, uh, manage, and this costing is based on per your own usage only. How much you're using? That's all it cost. So that is why we went for, uh, that is why we went for power functions compared to the vertex end points. And on top of that, since it supports multiple, uh, languages, like custom scripts, so it was easier to maintain and integrate with the repository trees like Cloud Source repository or GitHub like that.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your consideration of cost and the practicality of managing solutions at scale makes a lot of sense, especially for a POC. Shifting focus a bit, I'd like to delve into your experience with data orchestration and transformation. You've mentioned working with Fivetran and Google Cloud's Data Fusion. Can you discuss a complex data integration scenario where you utilized these tools in combination, and the specific challenges you had to overcome?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So, uh, this was, like, before the couple of like, the before my couple of junior projects, this was for one of the biggest marketing agency of North America vision. And the we had to build pipelines with their social media accounts, like, uh, pull that data and then ingest it to it or find into a data warehouse. To to do that, like, what we built, we either had an option of building an entire pipeline in the Google Cloud. Like, either use, like, something like a data fusion or a cloud compose and do the transformation there and then ingest to the BigQuery. But the client was a marketing team, and they were like, we are not that technical folks, so we want a nontechnical solution. So that's why we even fed Firetron. So Firetron, uh, like, pretty much is very easy. Three parts it has. 1st, we have to establish the destination. Destination is, uh, BigQuery, uh, that we establish using the service account with the client provided, then the fur then the second is the source. So source, each of this so we had, like, 2 to 7 sources, and the 6 were the sourcing social media sources like LinkedIn, Twitter, uh, Google, Centimeters, like, campaign manager 360. Uh, so these were the sources. On top of that. They were also on email source connected. So 7 source we were able to connect. Right? So to that. Now the third step was transformations. So what are transformations we need? We kind of, uh, pulled, like, put in those transformations and just into the big way. So, uh, some point is we need to take care of is, like, cost. So why? Because, like, um, Firetrend does the costing based upon active monthly rows. Right? So when we say active monthly rows, like, how many rows are being pulled and then ingested to the big query? So that also includes how many fields also. So we were very selective in what fields we actually needed, and we kind of removed, uh, unnecessary fields and other stuff. So that first, that led to the cost optimization. 2nd, in the BigQuery itself since it was in a virtual and, like, social media data over a time period. Right? So we optimize the BigQuery, like, destination itself by making it to the partitioning as well as cluster tables because they won't need the whole, uh, like, last entire, uh, 2 or 3 years of data. I'd mark this and then like, hardly those kind of analysis were being done by the client. So it was more on, like, monthly basis, and also we use that information to optimize the BigQuery handle. And then third thing was the real time versus near real time. So FireTime does to, like, in our experience, it does a near real time, which is not like an full real time. So that would kind was comfortable and agreed, like, they were finding the near real time. So when we went with the whole implementation in the file, and the transformations was done using a tool called DBT. Okay? And, uh, it's a it's pretty much the scripts are written very closely to SQL SQL language, and then whatever, say, like, joins and higher level transmission of the file, we wrote that. This was, again, integrated within the big sorry. GitHub where, like, each of, like, dev had our own branch and, uh, like, prod and same goes for the staging and prod. So that one this is, like like, the entire process of the project of the file client and the data function.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the complexity of managing costs and data accuracy in a near-real-time environment, how did you approach monitoring and ensuring data quality throughout the pipeline, especially considering the dynamic nature of social media data and the transformations applied through Fivetran to BigQuery?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Cool. So, uh, to answer that monitoring, logging, and the dynamic changes of data that we were able to control with the, like, 2 way help. 1 is manages a lot since it's a fully managed service. And second, we also had an exception handling in the transformations being written in the, uh, DBT of file. Right? So that if any error comes, it will automatically send notifications to the I g sorry, to the client team, uh, via the emails and as well as the admins. So this is how we were able to do the monitoring and, like, continuous improvements in the models.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you've implemented robust monitoring and exception handling processes. Now, let's pivot to a more technical focus. Can you explain how you've leveraged Cloud Build specifically for CI/CD in a data or ML project, and what challenges you encountered with this approach?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Oh, yes. So, uh, Cloud Build was, uh, we primarily integrated with the GitHub. Okay? And, like, we had, like, for each of the, like, environment, be it a dev staging and prod, we had, like, equivalent branches. So we kind of, uh, used that branches and based on for example, for dev and the staging. Right? So we whenever push first, there'll be automatically used to build and deploy the new version between particular, uh, models endpoint. Okay? So that what it what it does, it helps in saving time, like, number of clicks of, like, me manually uploading, like, making a a container out of it, and then deploying it to endpoint. So this whole process was being done there by using an YAML file. The third, that is the production. They'll be restricted because we didn't want to like, in case there is an, let's say, an unknown push or unintentionally, like, person hasn't, uh, like, has pushed something to the prod branch or false pushes there. So something There's a bit restricted there, and we kind of had, like, a manual trigger. Then only, like, a cloud build was been pushed, and then the dev deployment was being done according to the production. So this was the process we I used for the cloud build.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given this setup with Cloud Build and GitHub for CI/CD, how did you manage dependencies, especially Python dependencies that might be crucial for your ML models or data pipelines?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Correct. So, uh, dependencies, generally, like, how we we for Python is simple, we have a requirements of txt. Right? So there, along with the libraries, we need to mention the versions also. And with current, uh, how, uh, quickly, like, libraries and developments are going fast. Right? So it's very important to mention the versions also so that, uh, your code doesn't break. And these all the steps, like, in terms of, uh, installing, then building, then making Docker files, and then containerizing, All these were being written in the YAML files, and that YAML file was being used by the Cloud Build to complete all the process as well as the dependencies. Okay?\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Could you discuss a scenario where you had to optimize a Python-based ML model for performance, and which techniques or libraries you found most effective in the GCP environment?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So, um, ML models optimization, I would say that the improvement I have worked upon. For example, uh, pretty much, let's say, like, uh, the use case was about an so our use case was about, let's say, like, identifying the characters on your tire. Right? So, uh, it was more of improving the accuracy and the, like, all the, uh, what should I say, precision metrics and confusion and all. So what was the issue for us? Like, for example, 0 and o were same. I and l are same. Right? So in those cases, it becomes very challenging for the model to work upon. So we I kind of what I did was I kind of applied, uh, certain, uh, image processing technique, right, prior to the, uh, like, actual classification. For example, making it, like, black and white so that, like, all the extra colors are removed, and then making it, like, higher in the sharpness and so that we can I didn't the machine can identify what is an o, what is it, like, capital o, and then giving more samples to it as well? Like, because, uh, like but the samples amount of samples has to be, uh, correct. It can't be, like, too much such that it's, like, might lead to in class imbalance as well. Right? So that should not be the case. So given exact a good amount of samples for all, but at the same time applying image processing techniques like, uh, handwriting, like, as I mentioned, RGB, and black and white, increasing the contrast, sharpness, making the picture more clear, applying anti blood techniques and also in terms of, uh, that was, like, one of the thing which I kind of improved, not, like, in terms of performance, but in terms of, uh, model as such. Okay? And now in terms of libraries. Right? So there have been different cases of popular libraries which I have been part of using is, uh, NLP. Uh, like, for the NLP, I use NLP space c and all. And for the image, I generally use OpenCV. Okay? And on top of that, Google also has, uh, in house, uh, libraries, like Google Cloud Vision and Google Cloud NLP, where there are a lot of preprocessing, uh, features and techniques are already in built available.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given your experience with both traditional ML and deep learning models, how do you approach the decision of when to use which type of model, especially in the context of the GCP environment where you have access to tools like Vertex AI for both traditional ML and deep learning?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Correct. A good question. Why? Because, like, uh, for but generally when client comes in, right, cost is a major factor. Time is another major factor. And 3rd is dependencies. Like, what dependent is dependency they want to have. So let's say if a client is fine with a budget. Right? Then I can use the Vertex AI something called as AutoML and build the models quickly deploy and complete. Like, it's no hands on, no clicks. Sorry. Clicks are there. No hands on, no code assets. Okay? But let's say, like, again, if the client says, hey. I have a cost constraint, but so what to do? Then we go for open source model. So in that case, we've taken the open source models. We if we need, we retrain it using the deep learning techniques and then deploy to a particular endpoint accordingly. Okay? Now same goes for time also. Like, something like AutoML reduces time a lot. We don't need much time. We just quickly do, like, look a number of clicks and get it done. But if client says, hey. Uh, I have enough time, but I don't have enough budget. Then, again, we go for the open source models and all. And let's say the client is fine, and they have a team of their own way. They can manage the, let's say, the infrastructure monitoring, logging, and all Vertex AI offers opportunities according to like, for example, simple. A notebook can be a Google managed notebook or a user managed notebook. So the main difference is the cost and the time. So accordingly, if client based on client's needs, we'll go with that.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given this strategic approach to model selection based on cost, time, and client dependencies, how do you ensure the open-source models you retrain and deploy on Vertex AI maintain a high level of accuracy and reliability, especially considering the potential challenges of model drift and data bias?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So as part of mL of cycle, right there is a very important so initial first deployment itself. We do it we based on an understanding. Hey, this is the threshold let's say like 0.7 was essential score and accordingly. Like we will deploy the model but let's say like a new sample data comes in. We retrain the model. Okay, but before deploying that model to a particular endpoint, we can add certain conditions. Let's say like for this Matrix this has to be the minimum set of scores as well as if it doesn't pass don't deploy. So this set of instructions can be given to the like advertised mlops or the ml pipelines, okay? That is first thing second is there is very much possible ability of skewness or the deafness where like the like the metrics are not matching our expectations. Then in that case we stay or we go with the existing modeling but we do the prompts to the team so that if they want to apply any improved ml techniques or change the approach then we can reapply that okay on the new data and then accordingly apply the model and then for the user testing and we either testing candidate testing any test.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

So our, uh, our main objective was to do market with more modeling auto categorization and also, you know, IMDM, uh, trigger. And, also, I have done few project and product performance.

So, uh, in the in the in market mix modeling, we use linear regression because, uh, our the data we had is, like, kind of, uh, so we after clearing the data, we found that there were a really relationship between independent and dependent variable. So we wanted to stick with linear regression. So, uh, so we we went with the linear regression itself.

And for NLP, we used both clicks. I wasn't a complete part of that project because I was in the from the middle of the project. I got so the data was clean when I got introduced into model. So since I had some knowledge in the NLP, I I started exploring various models. So, uh, when we started, uh, like, introducing various other NLP models like ALSDM and BERT, but BERT gave, uh, good accuracy, uh, in in terms of, uh, precision and recall and also accuracy. So we still do it, the board model for auto calculation.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to model evaluation, focusing on bias-variance tradeoff and the use of adjusted R-squared as the primary metric for the linear regression model, is quite insightful. Regarding the NLP model, even though you joined the project midway, your exploration of different models like LSTM is notable. How did you manage the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, especially considering the potential resource-intensive nature of deep learning models like LSTM?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, when I got introduced that our categorization was that, uh, like, there were tickets. Like, we have to auto categorize based on that. Uh, so we had discussion with client on how to, uh, go through the accuracy and other stuff. So when when he, uh, like, when what was your question again? One second. Can you ask me?\\n'], ['Interviewer: Certainly. I was inquiring about how you managed the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in the context of the NLP model for ticket categorization. Given the discussions with the client on accuracy requirements, how did you ensure the chosen model (in your case, BERT or other NLP models) was both sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient for real-time or near-real-time categorization of tickets?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, like, we the do you to do the artificial medical category, we we use like, we had product like offer for a b a, and we we had to do it quarterly wise. Uh, so while doing that bias variance trade off, like we found that um, bird was giving more efficiency when compared to we just explored more various models. We didn't go through uh, insert the model the with the bias radius video. But when we got to, like, it it reduced, uh, we, uh, BERT reduced almost 95 percentage of the manual work which was put in there. So we tried to implement bot itself as our final model.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Implementing BERT for ticket categorization and achieving a 95% reduction in manual work is a significant accomplishment. Shifting focus a bit, I see you've worked with PySpark for ML. Can you discuss a specific instance where you had to optimize a machine learning pipeline in PySpark, and the techniques you used to improve its performance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Py PySpark, I personally haven't implemented in my, uh, client project because they were only using Python. Py, uh, PySpark, I have used as my learning, and, also, I have, like, just, uh, did a small, uh, project in my of my own, uh, like, of my own because because interest. I haven't, uh, deployed any model, uh, in, uh, PySpark using YAML, uh, but I know a few kinds of YAML flow, which is used in, uh, where where we can automatically, like, uh, put in all the, uh, data, and we can get the required output, uh, till deployment.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding your experience with PySpark as more of a learning and personal project tool is still valuable. Leveraging MLflow for model management and deployment in PySpark is indeed a relevant point. How do you envision incorporating PySpark into your client projects in the future, especially considering its potential for handling large-scale data and distributed computing for ML tasks?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So, yeah, uh, we have already, uh, we have already a discussion going on to introduce Databricks into our client environment or VDI because, uh, there, we we don't have to put put in manual effect to face the data from SQL and then, again, uh, claim the data using Python and put in other m one models by ourselves. So, uh, we have asked our client to, like, if if there, uh, like since we did this auto criteriation, it was not a huge amount of data. But we have the discussions are going on when in our client is are going to allow or like the database. Uh, we'll be trying to, uh, build our, uh, model in the memo flow from PySpark itself. So we have go have having discussion with our clients. So once they agree, uh, if the data is too large and it, uh, Python can't can't handle the data, We'll be trying to include PySpark as well in our client BDA.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Introducing Databricks into your client environment for handling larger datasets and complex workflows is a strategic move. As you engage in these discussions with clients about adopting Databricks and potentially PySpark for their projects, what are the key considerations you keep in mind regarding data security, scalability, and the learning curve for your team in adopting these new technologies?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So,\\n'], ['Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a pause in your response. Could you please continue with your thoughts on the key considerations for data security, scalability, and team learning curve as you plan to adopt Databricks and PySpark for client projects?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So Databricks, we can, uh, we have in encryption access control network security, data masking, uh, audit logging, and data loss prevention authentication, and also data governance. Uh, so a regular security audit, uh, we we approach this, uh, this all all this 9 or 8 things to our client Um, based on our, like, since, uh, we we concluded that it is a high security, uh, like it has high security for our data. They were our boss can't, uh, convinced with our thing. Um, so by this, uh, by by this, uh, by this financial layer, maybe we build we'll be trying to bring data breaks into our client environment. So we explained that all, like, the data governance, like, established data governance and produces, uh, ensure compliance and, uh, regulation standards. So, also, like, data security, uh, will like, we can have security audits and other assessment assessment also. So authentication, we can use, uh, like, strong authentication, uh, like, uh, a multi factor authentication or single on authentication. So we approached our client based on this, uh, uh, all these things. Yeah.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your detailed approach to data security and governance with Databricks is commendable. As you focus on ensuring compliance, security audits, and strong authentication methods, how do you plan to maintain the balance between robust security measures and the ease of use for your team, ensuring that security protocols don't overly hinder the development and deployment processes?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So yeah. Uh, like, since, uh, because, uh, data breaks even the data, like, uh, we have robust security or data security. We can use the data whenever we want. Uh, like, once it is deployed, we can easily, uh, take the data and we can use it for development. So I think there will be no challenge such challenge in the development if we bring data security or governance, uh, into our consideration. But, uh, yeah, we'll have to, uh, work on with the clients so the video sometimes, like, video will be slow. So we don't want to, uh, like, what's like, like, we don't wanna, uh, lose some time some somewhere or lost some time, uh, bit because of this issue. So we'll be working, uh, like, if the video is fast, we'll be able to, um, you know, do the development and other stuff so easily without any time constraint. Uh, that's what I'm thinking.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Ensuring that the robust security measures in Databricks don't significantly slow down the development and deployment processes is a valid concern.

Could you please share your thoughts on addressing potential performance impacts in a secure Databricks environment?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, like, we can, uh, use, uh, resource optimization, uh, like, uh, since we have optimized use of computer resource, like, we can keep with everything in a cluster or a auto scaling process. So we don't have any high security level and also so a storage efficiency will, like, implement data life cycle, uh, policy to manage data retention and detection. And also clusters scheduling. Like, uh, we can use clusters to run our data. So, like, we database uses clusters.

Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: You? Yes. I am. Thank you.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at Rampiva Legal. You mentioned signing the company's first vendor channel partner. Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced in establishing this partnership and how you overcame them?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, a channel partner, as you probably know, is the partner that's gonna sell your product for you. And, uh, in this particular instance, uh, there was a a company that was consulting with other law firms and other companies, mostly other companies in the in the construction field. And, uh, they processed with the same processing engine, which is Nuix. And, uh, I knew some people there. So I was able to take my personal relationship with them as, uh, as an in, if you will, you know, establishing some trust based on our our prior relationship, our prior performance. And, uh, uh, yeah, I was able to start talking to them. And after, uh, they agreed to take a look at the product, vet it, uh, the the product spoke for itself. It's a good product, and they were happy with it. So it it overcame that kind of initial resistance of, um, offering something they hadn't offered before.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant achievement. When it came to vetting the product, how did you address any concerns the partner may have had about integrating Rampiva's solution with their existing workflow, especially considering the unique needs of the construction industry?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Well, more properly, the unique workflow is the Nuix processing engine. Nuix is an engine that processes data in the discovery. It then goes into a hosting review platform and a number of AI and and tar tools as well.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a thoughtful approach to addressing these concerns. Can you elaborate on the technical aspects of integrating Rampiva's solution with the partner's existing workflow, particularly how you communicated this to the partner to build trust in the solution's compatibility?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. And I I guess to preface that by saying, I'm not the the technical, uh, consultant on that. I understand the technology, but, uh, you know, at that fine level, we have, uh, uh, subject matter experts. But the key thing here is that, uh, when Nuix processes, it's a very powerful tool, but it's a very cludgy tool. It's very difficult and very high maintenance. So when it came to integrating with their workflow, what we're able to show them is you have this very complicated workflow, uh, uh, in order to take advantage of all the, uh, the firepower, all the technology that you have in in processing. And by using the Rampiva, you're gonna get more out of it easier. So, uh, it's easier for staffing, uh, it's easier in terms of budgeting. And, you know, the key the key thing that grease the wheel, if you will, is that, uh, it allowed them to make far more efficient and economic use of something they already had.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the high-level technical aspects is definitely crucial for effective sales. Shifting focus a bit, in your role at Ryley Carlock & Applewhite, you led a team of approximately 8 members in eDiscovery and Managed Review. Can you discuss a specific challenge you faced in leading this team and how you addressed it?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, I think the biggest problem that team had was their value proposition, if you will. That's what makes what they were doing better than what other people doing the same thing were. So for example, their their value\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding and differentiating the value proposition is key. How did you work with your team to clearly define and communicate this value proposition to both internal stakeholders and clients, ensuring everyone was aligned on the unique selling points of your services?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think internally, uh, they understood it, uh, instinctively, but they didn't really, uh, were able to, you know, render it into something that was easily described. The the value statement for Riley Kerlock's managed review is that it was a law firm quality review, uh, at a discount price. There's different levels of review in the managed review business. You can get, you know, quick, cheap, and dirty overseas. You can get highly technical for things like IP and patent that is very expensive. So they were kind of, um, that law firm level review. That's a good level of review, a sophisticated level review, but kind of at a bargain price. So one of the problems they were having is they were, uh, competing for projects that didn't align with where their value proposition was. Some of them were either too technical or some of them were either, uh, uh, too cheap. They didn't need the value that we had, so they didn't need to pay for it. So the thing to get them working properly was to align, uh, the targets, align the the targets potential customers with the offering that we had. And the way that is done is by, uh, coming up with a marketing plan that targets the right kind of client. The client who, if they were in a position to say yes, it would make sense for them to do so. And that that kind of uncorked the dam and allowed them to start expanding.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Aligning the target market with your value proposition is crucial for business growth. Can you detail the specific components of the marketing plan that helped realign your target clients and expand your business in the right direction?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: No. I think I I think I have to a degree, but I can I can kind of reencapsulate them if you will? Uh, we were looking for clients that needed attorney level review. And, you know, review doesn't have to be done by attorneys. It can also be done by very sophisticated subject matter experts. So we were looking for certain types of review. Usually, a construction, as I've cited, is is 1, general business litigation, you know, things like this. By identifying the, uh, where our values showed up the best, we were able to go and look at practice groups and law firms and go, okay. They do the kind of work that is the kind of work that we're looking for. So by talking to them, we can discuss projects they've had or may have that, uh, could benefit from getting that attorney quality review at a lower price. That makes them more cost effective and more competitive with their clients.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Identifying practice groups and engaging with them to discuss specific projects is a targeted approach. How did you leverage technology or data analytics to identify these practice groups and evaluate the potential fit of their projects with your service offering, ensuring a more data-driven and efficient client acquisition process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: There's a number of ways to do that. Um, you have to kind of look in 2 large different categories. Larger law firms have a series of practice groups. They'll have some practice groups that are good targets and some that aren't. So if you look at the a law firm, you might say, well, some of this law firm isn't a good practice for is it a good target for me? But if I look at this law firm, if I look at the information that's available through various sources or even going as simple as going to a firm's website and saying, okay. What practice groups do they have? Are these practice groups that are good for us? They are. Then let's reach out to them. Then that's for kind of a general purpose law firm. The the second approach, uh, of kind of leveraging, I guess, you could say analytics, is looking for firms that specialize in these fields. And, yeah, there's a number of tools that are available for that that are relatively simple. And if you've been in the business marketplace for law long enough, there's some that are gonna come to mind. So that kinda gave us a good idea of who to target.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the different approaches to targeting law firms and specialized firms is insightful. Can you delve into the specific tools or methodologies you used to evaluate the fit of a practice group or a specialized firm, perhaps highlighting a tool or strategy that particularly stood out for its effectiveness in this process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I'd have to say it's not so much a tool because they're not that difficult to identify. You can look at a firm's website, or you can look at, you know, what type of law firm it is. It might say, we specialize in construction or mass tort or whatever it might be. Um, but I think it's more of an approach. Right? Uh, what was helpful in that instance was in identifying, uh, firms that did that kind of work was, uh, taking a consultative approach. And that's, I think, you know, the thing that you're asking, right, is what what process do you use? And in a consultative approach, we're gonna ask a lot of questions. We're gonna be lawyerly ourselves. We're gonna ask them about what they do and how they do it and where their pain points are and see if their pain points align with the offering that we have. If they do, we've gone a long way, uh, down the process of identifying someone who could be motivated to purchase our services. So that that takes, um, you know, some some some digging. And more importantly, it takes some listening rather than, you know, letting them talk rather than than you talk at them. Let them explain what their problems are. So I think a key thing there is the consultative approach.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The consultative approach to client engagement is indeed a powerful strategy for identifying alignment and addressing pain points. How do you ensure scalability of this consultative approach across your sales and client services teams, especially as the business grows and the number of engagements increases?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, the, you know, the number of engagements can increase. The size of the individual engagements tends to remain more constant, at least in the business that I was in. But even in businesses where it's not, right, some law firms might have, 1 or 2 projects a year. Some might have 1 or 2 a month. Um, it's simply a matter of asking the right questions to the white people, and then encouraging to provide you with the information where you can then go to your solution. You can go to your well of information and say, hey. I can help you here. You've laid out to me what you're doing and how you're doing it and where where the pain points are or you know, with a consultative approach, they may not realize they have pain points. They might be doing something and thinking, yeah, it works fine, when you're like, wow, they don't really realize this could be done much more efficiently. So, uh, that's, uh, you know, in terms of scalability, I think it it's simply a matter of, uh, whether the whether it's a large target or a small target, the approach and the process is the same. Of course, as you expand and you add more people, you have more people doing it. So, uh, you know, there's a practical limit, I think, ultimately to how much one person can can juggle. And that varies on a lot of factors that, you know, probably aren't worth going into right now about about the particular business itself.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the consistency in approach regardless of the size of the engagement is important. What kind of tools or methodologies do you envision implementing to help your teams better capture, analyze, and utilize client data to enhance the effectiveness of the consultative approach at scale?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think what kind of tools or processes would I would I, uh, use? I think, you know, part of it is teaching people to listen, teaching them to not just talk at clients of, hey. I have this, this, and this to sell. A lot of people try to I guess they call it feature sell. It's like, this is all the neat stuff that we have, and isn't it great? The problem that you can run into is that your stuff might be great, but if they don't have a need for it, you're wasting each other's time. So I think training might be, uh, one of the key things is teaching people what questions to ask, techniques to get people talking, and identify the right people to talk to and getting them to provide you, uh, the information in a in a give and take. You know, my background is an attorney. Attorneys are are trained to ask questions. Um, and I think people think, you know, they're trained to ask tricky questions, but we're not. We're really trained to ask questions to try to get to the truth of a point or matter. So, you know, there's a a variety of training programs available, but I think that's kind of the key thing is having people who are trained in the consultative approach that know how to use a consultative approach, how to implement it by the type of questions they ask and the process by which they go about their engagement. I think that's the key, and that's the thing that allows you to expand the scalability. And, you know, you can always expand the number of people, uh, on a particular project. You know, you might have a a smaller project and, uh, uh, you know, one person can handle it. But on a larger project, just prospect, you might wanna bring in some subject matter experts. There might be more stakeholders in this in this larger, uh, project. You know, there's a lot of factors that are I hate to sound lawyerly. It's one of those kind of it depends questions. Uh, but, uh, it it depends on a a lot of factors that we that we don't know as you and I are sitting here talking right now about what would what would make us determine what we need to put that consultative approach into effect.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Training and developing a questioning mindset are indeed foundational. Considering the role of technology in augmenting human capabilities, are there any specific data analytics or client relationship management (CRM) tools you believe could complement the consultative approach, especially in identifying nuanced client needs or patterns across engagements?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, these these tools are expanding by the day. Um, you know, for example, I've used the CRM called HubSpot and there there was a time when you were, uh, identifying potential prospect, you have to input manually lots of data about this prospect, you know, what their addresses, phone numbers, you know, uh, you know, information. With HubSpot, um, if you type in their web domain, it'll automatically populate all that information. And a lot of that is information that's useful to you in a consultative approach to go, wow. This is the customers they have. This is the business they have. This is, you know, the numbers they have. This is the growth or declining growth that they have. Um, you know, here's, uh, you know, Wall Street Journal articles, uh, you know, um, you know, the the use of of AI and a lot of these more advanced tools, I think where they really help, uh, it's not that they're better or that humans are worse. Um, I think they're better at some things and worse at others. But the key thing is how do they work together? Uh, I think that's important in the legal space. You know, with attorneys, it's, uh, you know, they tend to be a little off putting, uh, towards a lot of technology. But you have to explain to them and show them how this is a tool just like a a law book was, a typewriter, a pen, or a pencil. Uh, and they're they have to know how to use this tool in order to do their job. And, uh, you know, the\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: HubSpot's automation for data input is indeed a time-saver, especially in the initial stages of prospecting. As you've mentioned the use of AI in more advanced tools, how do you see AI being integrated into the consultative approach, perhaps in terms of analyzing client data or suggesting relevant lines of questioning based on patterns identified in the data?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: I think that's that's it right there is, uh, in the consultative approach, the more you know going in, uh, and when I say the more you know, um, there's things that you can concretely know. You know, what a company's revenues are, that's a that's a concrete number. What a company's perception is is not. So, uh, you know, I think the advantage of these tools and the way they can help in the consultative approach is they can provide you information like, you know, are their revenues stagnant? Are they growing? Are they shrinking? You know, this would be helpful, you know, when the when you're consultative approach. You'd say, I see that your business has been on a decline. This practice group, your your revenues have been falling. Um, why do you think that is? Let them tell you. You know, um, the machine, uh, learning there can help suggest the course of action. You know, um, in the actual legal work itself, uh, there's things like technology assisted review that help narrow down out of this massive information. They'll narrow down, um, documents along a certain theme. And the more that you select certain types of inputs, the more it'll deliver those inputs. So I think that's one way that it can help. But I think the key thing is, uh, the the person and the and the artificial intelligence working collaboratively, um, is greater than either one of them as an individual. And the, uh, ability to help provide factual basis to your questions that are gonna be the core of your consultation, I think, is probably the key there.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging AI to understand and interpret less concrete aspects, such as a company's trajectory, is indeed a powerful application in the consultative approach. How do you envision ensuring that the human-AI collaboration remains transparent and understandable to your team, so they can effectively incorporate AI-generated insights into their client engagements?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, I think there's a couple things I think. It has to it has to have a track record right as you use it. It needs to be solid. If the AI is giving you information that says this company is on a downward trajectory and it's on an upward trajectory that's going to cause a problem. I think just like a human being everything is always in a state of flux. It's in a state of growth and evolution and adjustments. So there might be situations where AI makes mistakes now ai doesn't make mistakes the way maybe I would of Simply being wrong, but it is subject to the the garbage in garbage or problem to a certain degree. So you is that happens? I think a process where We acknowledge that this can happen and that it doesn't AI tells us something it doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to do something on our own. I think of this process of Correction adjustment and increased learning is known and open and followed then I think you know people will work with it better just like they would a person or do the same circumstances\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: The interview? Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in both technical education and HR management. Can you tell me about a specific project where you utilized your technical skills to enhance HR processes or systems?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Uh, sure. I think, um, my recent, uh, job with SKU as a HR analyst is where I gained most of my hands on experience in HR. Right? So, uh, then we we, being a very small company, used to work majorly, uh, on Google Sheets and Notion, specifically for documentation and reporting and stuff like that. Right? So when we had a transition from using all of that into actually figuring out, uh, and implementing an HRIS tool and making sure, uh, it's adoption, uh, across the organization. That's where I think, uh, my technical skills kind of helped me in understanding which features were actually required for us as an organization, uh, which would be easy to use for, uh, uh, the employees and for the leadership in terms of the data they're looking for, in terms of the feasibility and ease of use that they would expect in the day to day usage. Right? So that's where I think, uh, this helped me in figuring out, uh, an HRIS system for our company and implementing it from end to end.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a great example of leveraging your technical acumen to improve HR operations. Transitioning to an HRIS can be quite complex. Can you elaborate on how you managed the change management process to ensure a smooth transition and high adoption rates among employees?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Sure. So the transition here, uh, was majorly triggered by the fact that, uh, uh, we fig we figured we noticed, uh, during one of our audits, uh, to improve processes and efficiency among the employees, wherein about, uh, for some of the stakeholders, 30 almost 30 hours per month was consumed by tasks like data entry, uh, updating sheets, and, uh, you know, just keeping track of data, which was scattered, uh, at multiple locations, uh, across multiple documents. Right? This was not a good practice. Also, there were challenges wherein, uh, you know, most of the communication, uh, for us, especially being a fully remote organization, would be over Slack. So anything that happens would be over a Slack message or a WhatsApp message at odd hours, which also hindered, uh, work life balance for a lot of employees. Right? So this so the idea of having an HRIS from an employee perspective was very important for us, uh, because it gave a lot of, uh, visibility around, say, for example, how many leaves do they have? Uh, if they have approved if they have applied for a leave, is it approved or not? They don't really have to do to and fro with the managers or, uh, with the HR leaders to keep track of that. Right? And likewise for the leaders as to, uh, uh, wherein they have a lot of visibility around, uh, what is the manpower in their team for that particular week so that they can plan things out accordingly. Right? So this solves their problems to the code wherein, uh, they don't really have a lot of to improve and enough visibility, uh, to operate smoothly. Right? So a lot of automation held here. Also, like I said, in terms of reporting and, uh, data that, uh, leadership usually prefers looking at while decision making. Right? So this is something wherein the leadership team was already aligned with. Uh, so I think, uh, overall, uh, because people realize that they had this problem and getting this into the picture, the HRIs into the picture would solve it for them, uh, Uh, they proactively were in the mindset to adopt and start using it. So people were enthusiastic about the idea. And to make it easier, what I also did was, like I said, uh, there was a whole process of training and, uh, making creating awareness among the employees as to how they can use it. Right? Although it's pretty simple and straightforward, uh, when you're using a new tool, you need some basic training. So that's where I pitched in, and I made sure that everybody received a basic training to, say, for example, uh, update the details, apply for leads, and, uh, download their payslips and stuff like that. I also created a handbook, which would give them, uh, an overview of, like, you know, what are the features they could use for certain scenarios. Say, for example, you want to appreciate an employee, uh, or one of the team members on the portal. Right? So so in front of the or, uh, in front of all the members of the company, in front of the entire organization, what are the features they could use? What are the badges we could create? So these are the kind of things which, uh, motivated them and, uh, gradually increase the adoption among the, um, employees, uh, in the company. Right?\\n\"], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you took a very proactive and comprehensive approach to change management, which is crucial for successful HRIS implementation. Your hands-on training and the creation of a handbook are excellent strategies for driving adoption. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you have experience in resolving employee complaints and grievances. Can you walk me through your approach to mediating a particularly challenging conflict between employees?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so to give you an example, um, one of the scenarios actually, most of the scenarios that we usually had, uh, was with respect to the sales and customer support team. Right? And, uh, there was this one scenario when there was some lead clash, uh, which had happened between 2 of our best performing individuals in the sales team. And, uh, to my surprise, uh, one of the members who actually raised the issue, um, mentioned that this had been raised multiple times before this, but there was nothing documented ever, like, you know, from their manager's end. A no action was taken to resolve it. Right? And this has been an ongoing issue had been an ongoing issue for almost, uh, 6 to 7 months before it came to me. Right? So, ideally, my, uh, my perspective is if it's a sales issue, if it's a process and policies issue, that's something which should be internally resolved by their sales manager and with their internal team. It should not be an HR issue. Right? But because it came to me, that's where I had to step in, and I had to coordinate with the sales manager to understand what's going on. And, uh, if at all it was reported previously, why wasn't it documented, and why hasn't it been resolved yet? Right? So, similarly, gaining perspective from both sides helped me understand, uh, where the gap was. And, um, thankfully, because I do have some experience in sales as well, um, during the early stages of my career, I could pitch in and I could figure out, uh, help them in creating some policies wherein, you know, the d day for the for the leads would be so and so, and post that, it would be transferred to so and so. So just helping them frame, uh, a policy which would, uh, which would at least to some extent, uh, make sure that these kind of clashes do not happen moving forward. Right? So that's what I did to resolve this.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to this conflict resolution is commendable, especially in how you collaborated with the sales manager to address the root cause and implement a policy to prevent future clashes. Given your experience in both HR and sales, how do you think this dual perspective has helped you in your role as an HR professional, particularly in understanding and addressing the needs of employees in a sales-driven environment?  \\n', \"Interviewee: That's a great question. Uh, so I think, uh, this experience that I have within sales has, uh, has really helped me in in a lot of ways. 1 is in understanding people, their mindset. So when you are on the other side of the table, uh, you do understand how employees think and they act and what to expect, uh, to some extent, uh, from the HR and from the management as well. Right? So this has helped me with, uh, with that, uh, respect. Also, um, like, being in a sales environment, I do understand something about, uh, leads and process, CRM management, and all of that. Right? So, yeah, I think, uh, this has helped me connect with the team to, uh, to a very critical, uh, level wherein, like, people trust me when I tell them that, hey. I have done this before, and I get you. I hear you when you say that. Uh, I understand this, and trust me, I'm going to figure it out. I have been there. Right? So it helps me build some credibility around, uh, what I'm speaking and, uh, for them to have basic trust in me that, you know, yeah, she she gets it. She she has also been through this and now she's in HR. So hopefully she's going to help us, right? So this is the sentiment that I that I usually engage in people, and I think this has helped me connect and, uh, build trust among employees and, uh, make sure that I that I leverage my relationships to, um, drive people in achieving their goals and making sure that they are motivated to perform. Right? So I think it's it's really helped me.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a valuable insight, and it's clear that your cross-functional experience has given you a unique advantage in building rapport and trust with employees. Your ability to relate to their experiences and speak from a place of understanding is a key strength in HR. Now, considering your technical background and your experience with process optimization, how do you stay current with HR technology and best practices, and how do you incorporate continuous learning into your role?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. So I think, um, like I said, process optimization is, uh, in my understanding, it's a very simple problem solving mechanism if you look at it. Right? Uh, it's typically identifying what are the existing process and, uh, where are the bottlenecks and then fixing things and optimizing things to make sure we have best efficiency possible. Right? So that's how I look at it. And, uh, to answer your question about, uh, best HR trends and technology and practices, I think, um, my go to place, uh, would always be Google and Charge GPT. Also, I do watch a lot of podcasts. So general podcast which help me understand, uh, a bit of knowledge about what's going on, especially in the startup ecosystem. And I do have, uh, my peers or, basically, my HR network in place wherein we discuss among ourselves and, we are like, hey, this is going on. Are you aware of this? Or I implemented this in my company. What do you think about this? So we exchange ideas and exchange knowledge. I think this is how I usually approach things. And, uh, whenever I need some feedback, I always look up to my my former HR managers or people who have relevant industry experience.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you're proactive in seeking out information and learning from various sources, including podcasts and industry peers. Leveraging your network and staying informed about the latest trends is essential in HR, especially when it comes to technology and best practices. Given your experience with process optimization, can you discuss a specific instance where you identified a bottleneck in an HR process and successfully implemented a solution to improve efficiency?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So I think, uh, with this, what comes to mind is the onboarding process that we previously had with one of my organizations. So what we noticed was the onboarding time was\\n'], ['Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a slight interruption. You were about to discuss the onboarding process and the onboarding time. Could you please continue with how you identified the bottleneck and the steps you took to improve the efficiency of the onboarding process?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Of course. So, um, yeah, like I was saying, uh, in one of our previous organizations, uh, I figured that the onboarding process, uh, could could use some some improvement, uh, considering, 1, the ramp up time for, uh, and this is particularly in respect to the sales team that I'm referring to. Right? So the onboarding, the ramp up time for the sales personnel took about some 5 to 6 months, which was surprisingly, um, really long in comparison with, uh, you know, what we usually see in the industry. So that, uh, also, uh, there was the the the approach to that to the whole training and onboarding process was very unstructured Wherein, you know, today, we finalize someone and, uh, the person is supposed to join us the next day. But because we do not have a structure in place, they would they would just not do anything for the 1st 3 days, and they were just sitting around and, uh, you know, it wasn't very effective. It wasn't very efficient as well. So this is where, uh, I figured that we should have, uh, a proper structure in place wherein we create a proper onboarding process. We mentioned, uh, what is to be done in day 0, day 3, day 5, and so on for the 1st 2 months. Uh, also, I made sure that all of these employees who were onboarded, uh, get got to got to learn from the peers, right, who had been in the system for at least more than 6 months. Right? So that's when I also introduced the buddy system wherein, like, uh, starting from starting from their offer acceptance, uh, that has been the sign, the joining letter with us, uh, until their, uh, you know, 1st 2 months in the organization were complete. They would be assigned a dedicated body from their own team who would be the point for any questions with the product, with the process, the system that they are using, any queries in general which is related to their work or which could improve their work, basically. Right? So I think this really helped us create a smooth, uh, onboarding process for the employees, also providing them a good candidate experience. Uh, and we noticed that eventually the ramp up time reduced, uh, from 5 to 6 months, which was the which was the previous, uh, time frame to about 3 months. Right? And this was a major, uh, major achievement, I would say, in terms of processes.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant improvement in the onboarding process, reducing the ramp-up time by half. The structured approach and the buddy system are excellent strategies for enhancing the new employee experience and accelerating their integration into the team. How did you measure the success of these changes, and what feedback did you receive from the sales team and the new hires after implementing the new onboarding process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So the measurement was typically, uh, based on, uh, the sales numbers that that we usually saw. So say, for example, the target would be, uh, for example, you have to close 10 units in a month. Right? So if that is the target and we saw people usually, you know, achieving that number by the 5th month in the company, this used, uh, this eventually happened towards the 3rd month in the company. Right? So that's how we figured that, okay, this is not this is working probably, and that is why people are able to perform, uh, in a lesser span. Right? And considering the feedback from employees, uh, I think employees were very happy. They they really felt happy that everything starting from the sales training to, like, you know, when would be the, uh, going for the sales training because these used to happen in person. So starting from everything, coordinating with them for the flights, with their, uh, stays, and, uh, with with the structured 3 day training program that we had in place to assigning their buddy wherein they could just go to their buddy and they could ask them, uh, about this and that and stuff, and they do not have to, like, sit and wait for the manager to be available. Right? So because the managers had a lot of work, and they also were in a way the bottleneck, um, uh, in terms of availability for these new joinings. Right? So that was not the case anymore. So I think overall, the employees were very happy about the new process, and they liked it.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that the new onboarding process not only improved the efficiency of the sales team but also had a positive impact on employee satisfaction. The tangible results in sales performance and the anecdotal feedback from employees are both strong indicators of success. Given the success of this initiative, how do you approach the challenge of scaling such improvements to accommodate a larger influx of new hires or a growing sales team?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. So, uh, to answer your question, uh, we, uh, we were a very small company. So at any point in time, the company's strength would not be more than 75 employees at best, uh, out of which about, uh, 35 or 40 employees would be in sales. Right? And, uh, like I said, uh, we introduced the buddy system, right, uh, for, uh, these new journeys. And I think the body system is something which is, uh, which really works well. It's also it's also a way for us to gauge, um, the potential the leadership potential in the existing employees. Right? Because, um, you or, you know, like, when you create these things for new employees, obviously, it improves their experience. But for the existing employees, when you hand them over with some, uh, some added responsibilities, that's when you actually see them feeling motivated and them feeling more into, uh, their work because they now know that they are responsible and accountable for somebody else. Right? So it's also a way for us to, uh, tap into the leadership potential, into our existing team members. And, uh, over a period of time, you know, promote them maybe to a team leader or, like, an assistant manager or some other roles, which would end on, uh, you know, create a major impact wherein, uh, they are capable of handling more than 5 or 6 buddies at one time. And they are also capable of, uh, showcasing their, uh, management skills or their reading abilities. Right? So I think it's a win win.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: The buddy system not only enhances the onboarding experience for new hires but also serves as a leadership development tool for existing employees. It's a smart way to identify and nurture potential leaders within the organization. As you look to scale this approach, how do you ensure that the existing team members who take on the role of a buddy are adequately prepared and supported in their new responsibilities, and what kind of training or guidance do you provide to them?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. That's a great question. So one is, uh, because they're starting up with 1 or 2 buddies initially, and, uh, they could expect a promotion in about 6 to 7 months, uh, right, later. Right? So that that provides them with some bandwidth as to what they can expect at the day to day. And, uh, additionally, what what we also feel is, uh, having these these sessions wherein we bring, uh, the existing older employees, uh, to the training programs, which happen, uh, which happen in person, right, for the new joinees would be a great way to showcase, uh, you know, how the sales managers, uh, are conducting these training sessions, how do they, um, how do they tackle these new joinees, what are the kind of data they look into, and, uh, what kind of conversations they have. So, basically, when when these, um, when these existing employees, the buddies, when they get to shadow their, uh, their sales managers or, uh, you know, they get to see, like, how they are taking care of their team. That's when they get a sense of what is expected out of them as well. Right? That's a great way to learn, sharing their own sales managers and learning step by step. Also, another another great way to, uh, inculcate leadership training would be, uh, making sure we we provide them sufficient access and support to be a part of relevant industry events and, uh, understand what's going on and be be a part of that, uh, make sure that their their inputs, their voice is good, um, in those kind of events and in internal meetings as well. This gives them a lot of confidence and credibility in their abilities as well. Right? So I think this is how we would make sure that the current team is prepared to take on leadership roles moving ahead.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. I'm ready to start the interview. Hello? Can you hear me?\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've built the analytics function from the ground up at two startups, Vedantu and Newton School. Could you walk me through the key steps you took to establish these functions and how you leveraged AWS in this process? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Could you walk me through the key steps you took to establish these functions and how you leveraged AWS in this process? Sure. So, uh, I when I joined Vedantu, Vedantu is a very small organization. It was a series b startup of around, uh, $200,000,000 valuation. Uh, the first thing that I wanted to do as soon as I came in was, uh, establish the data infrastructure in Virantu. Right? So what that meant is we have a, uh, infrastructure where, uh, you have multiple data sources coming in, uh, and and multiple data coming in from all these different sources. Right? And proper problems in, uh, early level start ups is key. You have lots of data, but you don't know exactly which data is correct. And leadership specifically is not our key on how to, uh, make decisions out of this, uh, improper data. Right? Because there are key issues with data inconsistency only mainly. And second thing is key, uh, everyone everyone kind of uses this particular data. Right? So so it becomes very difficult to make decisions, quality decisions, out of this, uh, this data. So what I did initially was, uh, we built a, uh, 3 it's a 3 part system. The first part is focused around the data engineering part, where we kind of, uh, segregated all the different data sources that we have. In terms of data sources, let's say you can have data internally being from of Mongo. You can have, uh, data in in some CRM like a Salesforce or a LeadSquared, or you can have product analytics, uh, softwares or tools, API connections where you store data. Right? Now what we did was, uh, we kind of filtered all this data using Airbyte and Airflow. We transferred them into Redshift, which is AWS. Right? Uh, Data warehouse. Uh, we use Redshift because it stores data very efficiently in the form of columnar database. It's because it's a columnar database. And, uh, this was the first step. The second stage was, uh, the data analytics well apart. Where we what we did was we segregated this data that we have collated from all the different sources that you have into a specific, uh, DB, which we call the data layer. And this layer essentially had all fact and dimension tables on Fact and dimension tables, meaning, I'll say, you have a user fact, which is a fact table at the user level, but that users are describing that, and the transaction tables, which is a transaction table. So a very standard definition of metrics and definitions. Metrics and dimensions is what we created. This was the 2nd layer. And the 3rd layer which we built on top of it is the aggregation layer, what we called the, uh, reporting layer. We aggregated all these numbers or all these features that we had or metrics that we had and, uh, reported proper aggregations in this particular, uh, layer. We re we stored everything in that particular layer. And this part these were the 3 steps. And this particular final stage, the reporting layer, the ARL is what we call analytics reporting layer, was connected to BI tool. In our case, the BI tool was the business intelligence, uh, very popular business intelligence tool called Tableau. We, uh, onboarded and and and maybe started it from scratch, uh, build dashboards on top of it. So the entire problem which we had at the beginning, right, data quality issue, the inconsistency, and, uh, specifically, data not being available quickly. Right? Those problems are solved because everyone started from the CEO to the very end. Right? To end stakeholders as in, like, some executives. Right? They had access to this quality data at their fingertips because everything was smooth line, uh, and, uh, everything was stored in a very efficient way. And if you just wanted to query anything, you can just you don't even have to query. You can go to the dashboards and and get that particular number. And the good part was key, it was very efficient in terms of, uh, pulling out numbers very quickly. So it improved decision making by making data available faster. And the second thing was the data consistency was there, so there was no discrepancy in taking any decisions. Right? Because everyone was there what data was saying. Specifically, if there was a problem in terms of, say, number drop, RCA could be done very easily. Even if there were some high highs, then you can exactly know what's contributing to the high highs. Right? So so this entire process took a big, uh, significant amount of time, some 6 months' time, And we finally made this particular, uh, entire part where we could, uh, streamline the data part in the analytics journey. Right? The second part was, of course, building a team, um, in in in the system because analytics journeys always have two important things. 1 is the data part. The second one is teams. And the third one is a mix of both where you align the proper team to the all resources, human resources to the to the to the projects or or to the data. Right? So the first part is what I had explained right now, getting in the data, sorting the pipelines, and the business intelligence framework is what we built in the first part, which I had just said. 2nd part was getting the team. We tried to follow an Airbnb model here where you have 3 distinct things. 1, the first thing is purely on the on the basis of descriptive analytics. Right? So what they would do essentially is look into this particular data. Right? So descriptive analytics and diagnostic analytics are the basic blocks of analytics. If I consider analytics into 4 parts, descriptive, diagnostic, uh, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Right? So diagnostic descriptive and diagnostic was the first thing. So what they would do is, k, they would look into the center BI part itself, that thing which I had meant, uh, spoken about just now. So they would be maintaining the data flow, the data sanity, and creating dashboards. So that was the entire entire job profile. Right? So they'll be very hands on with the technical use of data data in terms of engineering as well as with the visualization part. They don't have to do anything else. Right? But it was the first part. The second part was your, uh, the second team, specifically, was the insights team, which would go deeper into things which were going wrong. Or if something was going high, uh, or any change in any particular metric, then they would look into this, uh, particular, uh, metric and try to solve them from anything that we give. Right? So they were very good problem solvers, and, uh, they can they used to query a little. And this is the second team that we built. So any problem that needs fixing, these guys would be the ones to go to. And the third thing was essentially, uh, advanced analytics thing, which was on the predictive and prescriptive side. They would build models altogether. Right? Say a framework, analytical framework, analytical model, or something which which which everyone nowadays call AI. Right? So so something on that particular front, this was the 3rd tip. So this is the team sizing and hiring. This is what we tried to do. We scaled up from a team size of around 5 people to around 35, 40 people, and and it'll be a really great journey. So this was what we did in in Verano. So hire first of all, setting up the business intelligence part, 1. And second, getting in those teams, defining, first of all, what, uh, the teams should be and hiring for those teams, uh, specifically the 3 teams that I mentioned. Right? The descriptive and diagnostic part of the of the team, which should look into b I part, which I had already mentioned. The, uh, insights team, which would essentially be a problem solvers in the team and look into all stakeholders and domains and try to only solve problems using data. And the, uh, third part is the predictive and prescriptive thing, which would continuously work on longer term projects, say 3 months, 6 months project, but because it would be incremental in nature. So, uh, so, uh, a company at the current level is doing business at this level because of this particular change. Of course, it'll take time, but it could suddenly jump out the business from 0 to a 1 or 1 or to a x. Right? So that's the kind of approach that we took in building these things. Right? So, roughly, that's what, uh, we used in Veranto. Similar story with Newton as well. And, uh, again, uh, built a business intelligence team where that's the first step. Then we tried to fit in or create teams or charters. Right? Analytical charters, what would fit into what exact, uh, what charters would essentially be needed for what part of growth in that particular analytics journey. For example, if I need the marketing sales marketing analytics team, sales analytics, and what kind of activity exactly I needed. And based on that, hiring for that particular, uh, individuals in the systems and and and and sorting them out and and finally delivering projects. So, uh, that's more or less what I wanted to say. So if you have any, uh, questions on this, I'd be happy to answer. In the tools front, specifically, we were using multiple tools, uh, simply for data ingestion. We were using air by air flow for wrangling and stuff. And data storing, we were using AWS, uh, Redshift. We were using AWS s s 3. Then, uh, for visualization, we were using, uh, Metabase, Tableau, Power BI as well. And, uh, mostly, these were the tools that were being used. For product analytics, we were also using Amplitude and Mixpanel to some extent. But these data were specifically getting ingested in versus 7, so we had a final visualization there, which was Tableau and Power BI itself. So that's it for this particular question. Thank you.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for that comprehensive overview. It's clear that you have a strong grasp on setting up data infrastructure and analytics teams. Now, let's talk about your hands-on experience with predictive frameworks and machine learning models. Could you describe a specific predictive model you built, the tools you used to build it, and how it impacted decision-making within the company? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. I can, uh, talk about the attribution framework that I built in, uh, with Antu. So, uh, when I was given this project, uh, all start ups, and not only with Antu, was hitting trying to hit profitability. Right? So my charter specifically was how can we drive, uh, towards profitability by increasing revenue growth. So revenue growth essentially means how can I uh, revenue has 22 broadly 2 levers to play with? Right? 1 is by you can you increase revenue by increasing your volume of sales? The other one is increasing ASP. Right? ASP was with a different guy. He was looking into this other set charter. My charter was specifically around how can I increase revenue by increasing volume of sales? Right? Now, uh, the first time when I got this okay. This was the first time for me, and then, uh, uh, I tried to look, uh, into things from a very basic level. Right? As in, like, uh, from a first principle point of view, when I looked into things, I understood, k, uh, you have all these marketing channels that you have paid. Right? So you have, say, Google, different forms of Google Google, in fact. I'd say, paid search, paid video, YouTube videos, uh, USA campaigns. Then you have, uh, your, uh, Facebook, YouTube, all these different paid channels, Google, uh, affiliates and stuff, all these paid channels, right, in one hand. And in the other hand, in the organic side, you have probably SEO, direct organic, uh, referrals, and stuff. Right? Uh, so what we usually when I looked into this data or this particular problem, we found, k, all you have all these marketing channels at one end, and you're spending money to to get in more users in terms of new acquisitions out of this, uh, from this particular channels. Right? Now problem is you are not able to at that point, we were not able to allocate the exact outcome of these channels in terms of the money that they were bringing in in the form of my final conversions. Right? I'll explain this. So as soon as, say, someone gets, uh, acquired by Google's this is, by the way, in Veranto. So Veranto is an ad tech company. Ad tech company means we are giving free lessons to my user base, my free users. And if they find a value proposition, they will convert to buy the final product, which is a paid product of, say, ASP 35 k. Right? So it's pretty expensive. Right? So, uh, they need to build consideration. Can that particular product is what they would, uh, be most suited for, and that would benefit them in their long run. Right? So, uh, usually, the conversion cycle the conversion meaning from a free user, they would finally convert into a paid user, right, which is essentially we will get money from. Right? That's how how our our salaries would be paid essentially. So, uh, this entire journey, since the ASP or the average selling price was quite high, the the consideration billing time frame was significantly high. Right? Say, for example, 15 days. Right? So I'll give you an example in from let's say x comes or you even come to my platform. I you you come by, let's say, looking into a, uh, you you got hit by Google search keyword. Right? And you you downloaded the app, and then you, uh, forgot to sign up. And then next day, you get get something, uh, in Facebook saying, k. Okay. Because I already have I tracked your GAIDs. Right? So I I tracked your GAIDs, and then I popped you a message saying, k. Okay. K. You can come and sign up. So the second hitting point is, k, you you are getting hit by, uh, another marketing source the 3rd day. So you have signed up, uh, and you're not watching anything. So I'm giving you a you're watching a YouTube video and suddenly a pop up comes up here. Okay. Every time, it comes up, right, for a master class. So you click the come you you watch the master class, then 4 day, 5 day, you have not not coming to 6 day. Push to a, uh, notification. Right? IPN or or probably proper SMS or an email saying, okay. You can come to my platform and then do this, this, this. So what I'm trying to say is over the speed of 15 days, you're getting bombarded by different stimuli from across multiple channels. Right? So channel 1, channel 2, channel 3, each channel. Right? Page channel can be page channel. It can be organic channel. Now what used to happen was, uh, each of these marketing channels had had a marketing manager, and they attributed it's a classic attribution problem. So each time someone got approached by this particular channel, they would count this user as their user in, uh, in their final outcome. For example, if I got or you got touched by, say, my, channel, which, let's say, Google search probably, and then you did multiple iterations over time, and then then you got bombarded by multiple metals from multiple channels. But you would finally get attributed to me my channel if I can say that from my part particular perspective being then me, my myself being my, uh, marketing manager. Right? So what used to happen was every marketing channel attributed or any touch mark marketing attributions. So anytime someone types the market the marketing channel, the dollar get to used to get in, uh, the attributed to that particular marketing channel. So what used to happen when I looked into this, this is crazy. Right? You could not understand where to invest money because, uh, at the end, you were getting only $100. But if you add up all these marketing channels' income, you're essentially gets the 500. Right? Because everyone is claiming it's here to the bank. So the best idea was to build a marketing framework, which would essentially tell exactly how much weightage should a particular marketing channel get over the course of time for that particular $1 if if the user is paying, how much should that particular user get, right, or that particular, uh, marketing channel get? So, uh, we the approach to it is we try to it's a little complex. I'll, anyway, explain it here. We we built, uh, we define what type of users it is. We built an, uh, attribution framework on the basis of weightages and stuff. Right? Proper weightages giving it to every every user, every type of user, being a new user, recurring user, lapsed user, or a, uh, old user. And then on the basis of this, on the basis of what exact stage of this particular user, we give gave them and waited in the forms of if you were the new user, you would get a true And we did, let's say, 50% for the 1st source. 2nd source is will get x, y, zed some some some time something of that sort. Right? So, uh, we tried, uh, 1st source attribution, last source attribution, LNDT, which is last nondirect touch. Right? Again, there's an interesting story behind it, but now I'll skip that. LNDT, we use multi touch at weighted averages and have different sorts of, uh, uh, attribution models. Finally, we fixed something which we created on our own, which was a very intricate detail of how exactly we created each of these weightages on the basis of sources, the type of customer, and which channels they were being pulled from. Right? So we've built this model. Uh, and this particular thing, the post the launch of this, uh, tuition model, the results are very surprising and very interesting. We found that 70% of our cost, in fact, was driving only around 10 to 15% of my revenue. What this essentially meant is that you can essentially cut down this 70% of cost altogether. Right? So, uh, you can reduce inefficiencies by 70%, and still your business would go down only by 10%, right, which is acceptable. Because now you have the 70% extra pool of money, which you can reinvest in this your growth levers. Right? The 30% of your cost which was giving around 90%. That's the opposite of that 70, uh, 70 10 ratio. Right? 30 90 ratio. Can invest in the other part and drive up growth. Right? So this was a game changer. And if you remember it with, uh, probably around 2021, there was a massive restructuring as well. So this one this is the same framework which we had built or I had built, my team had built. We we tried to post this discussion with the CEO, Vamsi. We completely, uh, decided to close all these different, uh, avenues which are not making profit or not making any any sense. Right? Who invest 70% of your resources and get only 30%. Right? Only only only 10% 10 to 15%, not 30. So so, uh, and, uh, we decided to cut down categories, marketing channels, and, hence, there was this massive, massive restructuring we ran to. We decided to invest in growth levers, and then we finally, uh, got very great results. Right? The metric that we were looking into in terms of efficiency was a metric called COCA. COCA is very simple, collections on the numerator. And on the denominator, you have, uh, your cost, which is a marketing and sales cost. Right? We were trying to make it 2. Why 2? Because, uh, my academic cost, because we're an education company. Right? Or the fulfillment cost itself was around 50%. So if you if we can maintain this coca ratio 2, we would be c m 2 positive. Right? So that was the, uh, c coca 2 was our goal, and we were trying to get there. At the start of this project, we were hovering at around 0.7. And, uh, post this, uh, framework launch, and, also, we did some cohorting as well, uh, which is a different project, so I'll not club it in this. We did cohorting, which is micro targeting at at every user level. At the in code level, I exactly knew what exactly those users wanted. Superimposing that with this. We drove it up to efficiency of our the coca metric around 2.2, which is brilliant because we were trying to, uh, get a COCA of 2. So we were in fact, in this particular terms, we are successful in turning this into profitability venture. So, yeah, that's how we decided to tackle the overall problem of, uh, ambiguity, uh, in in in decisioning. We used the framework, which is an attribution framework, which is a predictive analytics framework. And the result was we were able to uh, distinguish out very clearly what worked, what did not work in terms of putting our money in, and then stop these inefficiencies. And finally, uh, we were able to turn around the efficiency metric from 0.7 to 2.2. Uh, and our target was 2. We shot up at most 20%, 10%. So yeah. So that's how we tried this problem out and use this particular framework, analytical framework, to solve this particular issue, and we were successful.

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've had significant experience with strategic projects and business growth at Unacademy. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you managed there and how you navigated the challenges? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So in May 2022, we were facing a challenge in revenue growth. So our growth was snagged. And, uh, especially in April May, the category was degrowing by 3%. So we had to come up with ideas that, uh, using which we can grow the category, especially in terms of revenue. And but the main point was we had not we were told not to increase the costs incurred to get that revenue numbers. So we brainstormed the team and came up with an idea of iconic mentorship program in which we fine tuned the sales pitch of our of, uh, of our sales team, and we also got in touch with, uh, the sales team to understand their feedback. What what is the problem that they are facing in in getting the sales done? In the same way, we we also that we also did a market research to understand what our customer base was looking for. And so we figured out that they're looking for a mentorship program with our product. We launched that program in less than 45 days. And this once this program was launched without incurring any additional cost using the resources that we already had, using the online contractors that we had. We ensured that the the product was launched as an additional feature with a little more as I've been with a with a little more changes in the SKU price, and then this resulted in great success. In the coming quarter, the category grew by 13%. So in this way, we navigated the degrowth in the category with without incurring any additional cost with a greater customer satisfaction ratio.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's an impressive turnaround, especially without increasing costs. It sounds like you have a strong grasp on both the sales aspect and the customer research side of things. Given your experience with the UX team in resolving learner issues, how do you approach the balance between user experience and business objectives when making decisions about product features? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Right. So these two things go hand in hand, user experience and the sales or we can say revenue growth. Uh, to keep things in perspective, uh, my from my experience, until the customer is satisfied, they'll not return and will not get the word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth is a publicity without spending any single penny on the advertisement and the marketing costs. So customer success is very important. On the other hand, once we connect to the customers, we also understand what our real use users want and what they are ready to pay for, Especially to understand things, uh, from an Indian buyer point of view, they are very, very conscious about the prices of the product and the services that they're paying for. So until they are satisfied to the core, they'll not return as a customer. And especially at Unacademy, we divide revenue into 2 streams. That is new revenue and the renewal revenue. So new revenue is the revenue from the leads or from the customers that has signed up that have signed up with us for the first time. On the other hand, the red renewal revenue means that these are the same customers who are returning to renew their subscriptions. So, uh, keeping things very short, uh, so it's very important to strike a balance between the customer success and the UX side of things. Uh, so how would how do we do it? So we do it based on the data that we have. So we have a ticketing software called Freshdesk in which we categorize the inbound ticket flow into different categories or different verticals. Let's say, from the UX point of view, if the customer if the user is asking for, a specific feature on the app. And let's say 45% of user asking for one particular feature, but 23% of users are asking for another feature. So we would implement the feature of which 45% of tickets have come from come for. So based on this, we sit with the product team and then we change the user interface or the product in all. So this this goes not only with the product, but but also with the content that we have on the app.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very data-driven approach, and it's clear you value customer feedback highly. Considering your background in analyzing business KPIs and performing revenue projection, can you walk me through how you approach setting KPIs for a new project and ensuring they align with the overall business goals? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So as a part of the growth, especially the revenue growth team, we have an overarching, influence over all the levels of the category. That could be GTM. That could be YouTube Pro. That could be customer acquisition. That could be the marketing cost or the performance marketing cost that that we incur. Having said that, how do we, uh, calculate the KPIs or how do we define the KPIs for a new project that that's coming up? That's a very interesting question. So it is based on the product that we are having all in all. So, for example, let's say we have to launch a category. I'll give you a real life example that happened. So we had to, uh, launch a specific product for a very specific target segment. For that, we had to, uh, do all the research, uh, and all the marketing and lead acquisition from scratch. So what we did was, uh, we launched a YouTube channel to understand to connect with our user base for a free marketing campaign. And then, uh, once this was done so once we once we call about YouTube, for for YouTube, the KPIs are the number of views, the number of subscribers that we have, and the percentage of videos, percentage video was. So, for example, a a video is of 10 minutes. Let's say, uh, user so cumulating, we have an average of 45% viewership. That means viewer watches it for 4 and a half minutes. That is API. So if the content is not interesting, the user are not watching your videos, that cannot be pushed by the YouTube algorithm. So that that is one KPI. For example, if the project is YouTube, the KPIs could be views, subscribers, uh, watch time, and, uh, the leaderboard. So we once we launch any, uh, new new channel on YouTube, we also keep a very close track of our competitors. YouTube leaderboard that is updated daily analytics team that, uh, so I have an analyst reporting to me. So so my way of working is that we keep a track on our competitors very well. So every video that we upload and every video that they upload, we have a neck to neck competition so that we can understand what is going on in the market. So for example, for for YouTube, the KPIs are views, subscribers, watch time, and are are ranking the leaderboard. On the other hand, let's say we have we are talking about in GTM, let's say, of pretest or a GTM event that we have done. So for that, the the KPIs could be enrollments that we get, the number of actual test takers or actual football that we have in that seminar or with that particular GTM that could be KPIs for that. Uh, going on a strategic scale, let's say we are launching\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you have a comprehensive strategy for setting KPIs and tracking performance against competitors. Given your experience with implementing lead segmentation and revenue triggers, can you explain how you utilized segmentation to improve your marketing efforts and what kind of revenue triggers you found most effective? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So a lead segmentation is a very important part of my job. So we have different kinds of leads that different kinds of users. So we are sitting on our user base of 2,000,000 users, 2,000,000 free users to be precise. More than 2,000,000 free users. Now all these users don't have the capacity to pay for our product. That we understand very well. So a conversion rate of x percentage, let's say. Now let, uh, we also understand that a user who's coming on our platform is also, uh, going on different other platforms of our competitor. So we do a behavioral segmentation of leads. That's 1. To understand that if, uh, so we categorize in the in the behavioral segmentation part, we categorize leads into abandoned cart. That is if the user has added the product in the, uh, added the product in the cart and then he has abandoned the cart. Another is That is payment payment failure. If the lead is trying to pay for the product and the payment is not going through, that's also a set of leads or or a set of cohort that we have. Another is that, let's say, a user is applying a discount code on a particular product, and then he's leaving the leaving the payment page. So from from that, we have a segmentation. We are able to understand that this particular need need set or this particular cohort size or this segment is looking for more discounts on the product. So we can roll out, uh, discounts of that sort. Now coming on, uh, revenue triggers. So discount triggers works the best for us. Value often triggers are are second on the number. So discount triggers so our product is really good. Our content is really nice. It's one of the best in the market, if not the best. So, uh, discount triggers work very well. Uh, in particular, discount triggers, we have seen a revenue growth of more than 45%.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very targeted approach to lead segmentation and it's impressive to see such a significant revenue growth from discount triggers. Given your technical background with a B.E. in Electronics and Communications, how do you leverage your technical skills in your role as a business growth professional, especially when it comes to understanding and utilizing data for strategic decisions? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So, uh, data is the soul of all the decisions that we make. It could be the revenue based decisions. It could be the decisions on decisions on YouTube. It could be decisions on GTMs. It could be decisions on P and L management. So we have, uh, these Tableau dashboards for everything for, uh, our watch time, for our learners, for for our YouTube growth, for our revenue, for our segment wise revenue, for our discount trigger based revenue. So we use Tableau dashboards extensively to, uh, dig deep into the data that we have, to understand and to fetch insights from the data because that is what the higher leadership is looking for, to understand how are we growing, how is how is the category going, growing, which which, uh, SKU is performing better, which SKU is not performing that good. So, uh, Tableau dashboards are one very, I'm sorry, very specialized technical tool that we use. Another is the Google Sheets. Google Sheets, uh, is something that we use very extensively in, uh, very extensively in our day to day operations. The other thing is, uh, more more often than not designing softwares, uh, Sigma and Canva that are used very extensively for all the communications that we send. Another applications that we use is WebEngage. WebEngage is not used by me directly, but I have a team of of associates that that send all our communications. Uh, using these Tableau, sometimes SQL, and, uh, Google Sheets. My technical background has helped me out to get get very well into these, uh, data digging the data analysis rules to fetch valuable insights.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your technical proficiency clearly plays a crucial role in your ability to analyze data and communicate insights effectively. Utilizing tools like Tableau, Google Sheets, Figma, and Canva demonstrates a versatile skill set. How do you ensure that the insights from these data analysis tools are effectively communicated to and acted upon by cross-functional teams, especially when it involves technical details that need to be translated into actionable business strategies? \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. So that's a very important part of category crew to to convey the message to the senior leadership that what is happening in the categories in term happening in terms of numbers, and to the other cross functional teams to make the mission statement very clear to them that what we are chasing or what we are after. Because if the mission statement is clear, all the teams can put their best to for the achievement of the goal. Now having said that, coming to how do we do it. So we do it in a very segmented manner. So, for example, if it's revenue, we do a complete end to end analysis of every SKU wise revenue, day wise revenue, auto wise revenue, week wise revenue, and month wise revenue. Now once we have this data that the revenue is growing for this particular SKU in this month, in this, uh, week. So now then we try to dig in that why has this happened. Have we given a special discount on that particular SKU, or we have given an extension or or a free extension on that particular SKU. So then we understand that, and then the same thing is translated to the other teams and, uh, senior leadership as well. Cross functional cross functional, uh, communication also plays a very important role because once we have so I'm also acting as a key account managers for very critical accounts in the organization or in the category. So we have these external contractors who work in whose whose payments are done in hours. So to communicate them that this many hours has been utilized, and we would like to use these many more hours of yours. This is done using the Tableau dashboards again, and this is communicated in both written as well communication is done so that, uh, external contractors will also happen because these are very crucial stakeholders in our operations.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's evident that you place a strong emphasis on clarity and transparency when communicating data insights to both internal teams and external stakeholders. Your approach to segmenting information based on the audience's needs and the use of both written and verbal communication to ensure understanding is commendable. How do you measure the success of these communications, and how do you adapt your strategy if the desired outcomes are not being met? \\n\", 'Interviewee: So to measure the success of all the communications that happened, So we can we do it in for most of the cases, we do it on a real time basis. For example, if we have communicated that this particular creative has to be changed and the team has not understood or they have not understood the essence of what we have been trying to communicate. We sit on a meeting with them, and we try to understand that what they have, and we try to communicate it again because, um, which when, specifically when you come to creative generation or something that that involves, uh, designs or videos to so communication plays a very important role. We have to sit again and again with the person without getting without getting irritated because, uh, to trans to transmit or to communicate that particular idea that what you are thinking and what you want to a person who does not understand the category very well. Maybe it could be a designer, mostly a designer, or some or a person from other team or other category. So you have to sit with them. You have to understand their mindset. Where are they coming from and where are you coming from? And then you have to sit with them too. And you have to come basically on a same page. Uh, having said that, uh, the another thing that is very important in case if, uh, the communications are not done properly. You have to sit sit again with them and explain it to them. So deliberation and discussion is the key for the success in in operational cases and also in planning.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Your approach emphasizes patience, collaboration, and iterative communication, which is essential for ensuring that complex ideas are understood and executed correctly. It's great to see that you value the process of aligning with team members from different backgrounds and expertise. Given your role in strategic projects and business growth, how do you stay informed about industry trends and integrate new insights into your strategic planning process? \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. So, uh, we have this culture in our team that anybody who gets news about anything, any new dynamics that is coming to play for our business, that is the active business. They keep on posting that links on our internal communication channels so that we we we can keep ourselves appraised about the the the Dynamics change or any other feature or any competitor that has got funding that has got funding. So in this way, we keep ourselves appraised with the latest industry trends and any new market dynamics that is coming into play.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a proactive approach to staying current with industry developments. Encouraging team-wide sharing of information ensures that everyone is on the same page and can contribute to the strategic planning process with the latest insights. How do you evaluate which trends or market dynamics are relevant to your strategic projects, and how do you prioritize their implementation into your business growth plans? \\n\", \"Interviewee: So I'll give you example from from last year. 1 of our competitors got a funding of around $1,000,000,000. And, uh, as soon as this news was broke out to us, then we, uh, we got into a team meeting. We got into a hard long Slack. And then we figured out that this particular competitor has 6 different categories on that time. And let's say they they want to double their category numbers. So let's say they are launching to a 6 more categories. That's in all in all, they'll have 12 categories. Now how how what kind of a market share do they have in our business? We calculated that. And based on that, we try to estimate how much money can they actually pump into the market to bleed the market. That could be 1. Or for lead generation, that could be another. Uh, by bleed the market, I mean, they could reduce the prices of their products to such a level that it would be it would be so competitive that a learner would not have any other choice than opting for their their courses or products. So once this was done, it was a post priority for us to because we cannot reduce that price. We could not, uh, reduce our SQ prices to our competitors. So we we maintain that qualitative edge. So we once they have received funding, they would also try to poach our external contractors. So we, uh, escalated this way in advance, maybe 40 days in advance to our leadership, and we got special financial approvals and offered special incentives to our external contractors that to ensure that they are not pushed. We also did some changes to their agreements, and we we had a lock in lock in clause that was put in into their contracts. In this way, we prioritize that our contract our external contractors, our our educators are lost in the game. On the other hand, we also understood that the kind of marketing campaigns and the kind of the kind of market share that we will lose in the coming quarters are, uh, is due to this sudden influx of money into our competitors' bank accounts. And so this was already communicated to our senior leadership so that they do not get worried and they cannot get walked up. And this is also communicated to all our junior associates, so that they do not lose hope in our product and our business. In this way, we prioritized and we, uh, we ensure that our business stay robust and, uh, we can grab the market share that we have, or we can also reclaim the market share after the coming quarters once we once the competitor has done the kind of operational the kind of marketing or money pumping in the market that that they were planning.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: View? Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on outlier detection at Expedia Group. Can you tell me about a specific challenge you faced while working on this project and how you overcame it?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So this project is regarding productionization of, uh, uh, outlet detection. So it's like an application which, uh, can have any input and it's a unit, uh, outlet detection algorithm and we have to specify that, uh, uh, this type of algorithm we need to apply for getting the outlier. Like, a simple sense, we can use, um, k deviation from the mean or we can use a profit model. So these are the the 2 algorithms which is generally used right now. And, uh, my work was to productionize it and, uh, also a creative feedback loop around it. So this feedback loop means, like, uh, our system will run on a daily level. It will be a a spark job. Uh, it will run daily. It will test the data. It will run the proper model on each of those features, and it will store the results, uh, to some of the circuit. And, uh, it will if an outlier is directed and it will log the data in the DynamoDB table for quick access, then a feedback will be sent to the Slack channel. Now from Slack channel, uh, human in the loop like data scientist or data analyst, they have to manually check whether the data point was really an outlier or not. So it's a human feedback which is also getting captured. And, uh, from Slack, like, they need to click on that confirm button, which cause a Lambda job. And that Lambda job updo updates the particular records entry and then a more difficult table that for this entry, like, the human in the loop has also detected also detected it as an outlier. And that, uh, thing is being used for the next stage outlet reduction. So creating this feedback loop was a challenge. Um, it was an infrastructure challenge or engineering challenge, I would say.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you had to implement a robust feedback loop system to improve the outlier detection process. Given that you mentioned using the Prophet model, could you elaborate on how you integrated this model into your system and what kind of performance metrics you used to evaluate its effectiveness?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, it's not like, uh, we are like, uh, basically, we are using proper to detect the outlet data points. It's like it takes, uh, the last 30 days of data as a training data point, and we have said the para hyper hyper parameters for the profit model that is some default parameters. And let's say, today's or later, see this data point will be considered for the inference part. And, uh, with the help of training the training period, we'll get the minimum bound and maximum bound, and we will check for the latest 3 days whether it is inside the bound or not. If it is not, then the system has to throw in out has to detect that point was later as an outlier. I have to send the relevant notifications. So we are not evaluating any model over here. And, yeah, like, the ML scientists, when they were doing the analysis or experimentations at that time, they figured out that these are the optimal parameters for the profit model. Right. Yes. That's all.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, you've implemented a straightforward monitoring system using the Prophet model's bounds for outlier detection. Shifting gears a bit, I noticed you've also worked with BERT for NLP transaction categorization at Oracle. Can you discuss how you fine-tuned BERT for your specific use case and what kind of improvements you observed in the model's performance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so over here, like, uh, we were not fine tuning the bot model for our use case. So it's like, uh, it was like categorizing the transaction relations. So we created the embeddings of transaction categories. Like, we created 100 categories embeddings, and we saw it, you can say. And, uh, whenever a new transaction comes, we do the filtering of the text. And we say we'll see we do all the preprocessing of the textual information from the translation region, and we give a sentence. So we create the embeddings of that sentence using same BART model. And we use call center to figure out that which of these categories are most resembling to our narration. Uh, so basically, we use bot to create the embeddings of, uh, our input narration and all the categories data which we have with us. And DocuSign similarity to this give out the most matching categories.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a clever approach, using BERT for embedding generation and cosine similarity for matching to transaction categories. Can you tell me more about the pre-processing steps you took for the transaction narrations, and how you ensured the quality of the embeddings for such a diverse set of data?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. Uh, so it's like, uh, it's like a bank transaction statement. So from there, what we do is, like, we have to remove the numerical information and also, like, uh, any extra symbols which are not relevant in that particular narration. And after that, we get, uh, like, a a clean sentence. Like, it might be, let's say, Zomato hyphen I and hyphen some number, something like that. So we have figure out Zomato out of it. Uh, so it was, like, uh, some rule based approach. We had a set of rules which based on that, we were filtering the text. And let's say we have to figure out, like, uh, if we get any like, any matching category out of our set of categories. But if we don't get any matching category, uh, with the help of what then what we used like, we have kept a threshold, and the cosensibility score should be above 0.7. If it does not, then what this our system was used to do is, like, um, our process narration will be sent to the Google search API. So, like, the Zoom item, it will be sent to the Google to understand the contextual information of I mean, understand the meaning of this word or this set of words. So, like, uh, Google will say that, like, this is, uh, for delivery platform chain and so on. So it will give a sentence. So we, like, we extend that sentence from the Google search API's result, and we were feeding the embeddings of that sentence and then again comparing with, um, other set of, uh, transaction categories using BERT and cosine similarity.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you've put a lot of thought into the pre-processing and fallback mechanisms for cases where the initial embedding matching threshold wasn't met. Using a rule-based approach for text filtering and a third-party API for context extraction is quite innovative. Given the complexity of financial data and the potential for sensitive information, how did you handle data privacy and security concerns, especially when integrating with external services like the Google app search API?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. Uh, so, basically, we're filtering, uh, all the relevant information I mean, all the confidential information from that narration. Like, if, let's say, it's a bank cash withdrawal term. So the sentence which was going to the search will only have the words of the narration. And the total narration translation narration is having at least 25 to 30 character length. And when we remove the relevant characters out of it, like, we hardly get a 10, 15 character length information, and, uh, like, uh, those information was not any confidential information.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a prudent approach to maintaining data privacy by ensuring that only non-sensitive information is used for external searches. For the remaining part of the narration, where sensitive information might still be present, how did you ensure compliance with data protection regulations, and what measures did you take to secure the data within your own systems?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: I didn't click like, uh, over here, we were having that kind of issues because, like, the final data which we were giving, uh, to the API, to the Google search API, it was having the sentences or words. It was having the set words. So you can say 2, 3 words in 1 narration. And those words are you can say they are related to some, uh, restaurant name or some it will be some shop name or some restaurant name, basically. So that information is already in the public domain. So we were not having the issues of, uh, predicting the data and data security.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Understood, it sounds like you were able to leverage the public nature of certain data elements to avoid privacy concerns when using the Google search API. Given your experience with machine learning models and the various tools and frameworks you've worked with, can you describe your approach to model versioning and deployment, particularly in the context of the projects you've worked on at Expedia Group and Oracle Financial Services Software?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Uh, can you explain the question once again?\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Certainly. I'm interested in learning about how you managed the different versions of machine learning models during your projects at Expedia Group and Oracle Financial Services Software. Could you explain the process you followed for tracking and deploying new versions of your models, and how you ensured that the deployment process was smooth and reliable?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so I will explain about Expedia. So we have a model registry service system. And what happens is, like, uh, when we train our model, uh, like, we have 3 different environments. 1 is a Databricks environment in which ML scientists do the R and D work. And, uh, I'm I'm an ML engineer. My role is to take the, uh, system build by ML scientist and make production as it and maintain it and track it as well. Uh, so we have a model is the service in which, um, you can store a model or you can store any object file inside it. Uh, and a version tag is assigned, and you can give a set of tags along with your version file. So it's like in the back end, it is storing the data in some s three bucket, and it is maintaining a dictionary. Okay. Now when it comes to deployment part, uh, we deploy we create a docker image of the application, and we in that application itself, there will be the code and the ML model. We fetch the ML mod we have a GitHub Actions workflow, which fetches the model from MRS, create a docker image of our entire code, which has the model artifact in it as well. Then this docker image is, again, registered on MRS, uh, model history service. Like, um, we'll just start basically a Docker image over there. Like, this is Docker image for this particular application, and it gives a relevant version to it. And then we deploy it, uh, with help of model internal model deployment service tool. It is build it's like we deploy dockers with the help of Kubernetes, uh, on AWS easy to instances. Then, uh, we have to specify, like, let's say it's a live inference service. So how many parts we have to give or, like, how we have to monitor, like, what will will be the scaling policy? And, uh, you can say, like, what will be the time out policy? So we dip we define all those envelops configurations when we are deploying with the help of Kubernetes. And in terms of monitoring, like, um, let's say, for live inference service, so we monitor, uh, latency request failure. So for that and a lot of different parameters, like, which all you see 2 instances are having are working for this, uh, application and how much is the error rate or the success rate for each of those EC two instances, uh, whether a port is failing or whether the port is scaling when the number of request increases or decreases. At the time of testing, we do load testing as well to figure out whether our model will handle a huge amount of traffic or not. Alright. And, uh, so to create this monitoring system, we make use of data log to log other metrics over there.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive explanation of your model versioning and deployment process, highlighting the use of a model registry for version control and the integration of CI/CD practices with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services. The emphasis on MLOps configurations for deployment is also key for maintaining performance and reliability. Given your experience with monitoring, can you discuss how you've used tools like DataDog to monitor the performance of your machine learning models in production, and perhaps share an example of how you've identified and addressed a performance issue based on the metrics you were tracking?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Alright. Uh, so let's say, like, uh, it's a live inference service. So we track, uh, um, the accuracy rate of no. Not not accuracy. I will say, like, uh, the latency rate, like, how fast our request is being solved by the model. Then we check, uh, and the request comes in the real time and the response initial will return. So it's like, uh, we use a fast API app to build it. And, like, uh, we monitor a number of requests which is being fed to the model per second, then, uh, number of ports which is running right now. What is the memory consumption in the port, what is the CPU consumption in the port, uh, whether it is increasing over the threshold, like, so it's and we basically monitor the error rate and the tree latency threshold. Like we said, in this in one of our project, we have said the latency is 300 milliseconds. So if it goes above so it means, like, the number of ports are less for us or the number of port configuration is, uh, I mean, the instance type of the port is, um, not supporting our application. So we have to increase the instance type. I mean, have a better machine. And also to increase, we have to increase support to support the latency. And regarding the error rate, we have to, like we have we store all those logs on Splunk. So, like, uh, we have to fig I have to check the logs to figure out, like, why some of the requests are failing, what is the underlying reason behind it. In one case, it was, like, uh, the client team was having a time out of one second. Like, they will send the request, and they need the response in just one second from the model. But in my model itself, like, um, we are calling a dynamo DB service to fetch, uh, uh, features to like, in DynamoDB, we used to store the features for live and friends. So to fetch those features from DynamoDB, it we had a time of of one second from there as well. So it's like, uh, the client team has set a time out to one second, but our services also set a time out to one second. So if some features are not available on DynamoDB, so it gives the error after one second is over. And by the time we throw the error, you know, to the client team that, uh, for this specific, we were not having the feature. The client has all already disconnected the connection, and we were getting a zero error. So this was one channel which I figured out, and we monitored the time out of from the client team. We because it took a second and so that our system was able to give relevant response, uh, and it was 1.5 second. Then comes, like, uh, another thing of monitoring called model drift. So it's like, uh, there's 1 batch of inference application in which we check, like, whether our models like, we train that, um, we do the inference for this batch inference model at every weekly level. So in every week's output, we check the model drift with the help of population statistic index, a PSI to figure out whether the current set of, uh, result has been different from what was there in the previous, uh, at the time of training of the model. If it does they they they differed a lot in the PSI indexes, um, greater than what I will say 1. So it means, like, there's a model drive time. It's a time to retrain the model. So this is how we do other monitoring.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: You've provided a detailed account of how you use FastAPI for building services, and the specific metrics you monitor, such as latency, error rates, and resource utilization. Your experience with identifying and addressing performance issues, including client-side timeouts and model drift, is crucial for maintaining a high-quality production environment. Given your experience with model drift, can you explain the strategies or tools you've used to retrain your models in response to drift detection, and how you've automated this retraining process to ensure minimal downtime for your services?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. Uh, so it's like, uh, there are 2 cases of retraining. It's like, uh, one case is that figure out that, uh, the the value is less. But, again, like, uh, in Nextiva, we cannot retrain them. There's one thing, like, we if we want to retrain, then we will set up a feature that, um, the retraining should it should be a live retraining model. Like, the retraining should happen every weekly level. So that is one case. 2nd case is, like, um, if you want to retrain the model, then it's, like, uh, then assigned to set to sit down, figure out, like, what was was the issue with the previous model. And to roll out a new model, then we have to release a proper UAT first, then release a proper AB testing first for a 1 month or 6 week of time period. And, uh, we track, like, uh, whether the new model is performing better than the previous model or not. If they testing results are conclusive, then we roll out to the new version of the model. Now for the rolling out, it's like, uh, we deploy the next version of of our docker image, uh, with the new new model by our model deployment service on Kubernetes. And it's, like, once a new service is like, during the AB testing service, like, the new service will be serving 50% traffic and the old service will be serving the less less 50% traffic. Now when we roll out that 100% traffic to the new to the variant group in the AB testing, so it means, like, uh, the ports will scale out for the variant group. And once it is in all the ports for the variant group, uh, has been allocated, then the request will be sent to the variant group. Once, uh, the request has been successfully sent to the variant group, then for the control group, uh, the ports will start decommissioning because it is not receiving any request. And this is how we roll out to the next version of the model.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to model retraining and deployment is well-structured, emphasizing the importance of live retraining and thorough testing through UAT and AB testing phases. The gradual rollout strategy using traffic splitting is a best practice for minimizing risk during deployment. Can you elaborate on how you measure the success of the new model during the AB testing phase, and what specific metrics you look at to determine whether the new model is ready to be fully deployed?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Alright. Uh, so there are a lot of more metrics, I will say. And, uh, those metrics, like, uh, there's a data science team. Uh, you can send data analytics team who does, um, this part of work. And it it's like they track one thing I can say is, like, uh, I was working on one ranking system. So let's say a new model gives the rank. So we check, uh, the numb what are the number of clicks which has been made on the suggested rank and the number of conversions or number of bookings. Uh, so you can call us these are the rates which we monitor them. We check another thing. Like, we have given a set of rankings, but whether the user have clicked from those set of ranking or whether they have changed to some other set of ranking or whether they have made any other kind of searches. If they made any other kind of searches, it means that our ranking was not relevant to them. That is why they made some other kind of search. So this is another rate, uh, which we monitor, which we evaluate, basically. And based on all these scores, uh, the data scientist team, like, uh, they make the solution that whether it is a good conclusive result or not.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Monitoring user engagement metrics like click-through rates, conversions, and bookings is indeed critical for evaluating the performance of a ranking system. It's good to hear that your data science and analytics teams are involved in making these assessments. In addition to user engagement, do you also consider any operational metrics, such as system resource utilization or error rates, to ensure that the new model is not only performing well for users but also maintaining system stability and reliability?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: It's like we monitor the port configurations as well. Like how much is the CPU utilization and the memory utilization and as I told like we monitor the latency which is given by the new model and if like in one of the case of a testing the new model was build on XD boost distributed XP boost and the previous model was it was also based on xbos, but it was not a distributed examples. So for the new model like the effect size was more and it was the intense time was more for the new model. So we had to increase the pods number of Parts number of kubernetes parts to support this new model. So it's like when we are rolling out the new before we roll out the new model. We do a lot of testing. To figure out that how the models were performed when the real traffic is being introduced also like before testing. I'm after we done the Lotus testing like lot testing is on our own set of data points. We use Lucas to do that. And after that before starting the testing we sent a shadow traffic 50% Shadow traffic to our model is well for one week time frame. So that helps us to say that in the real traffic is being here, whether our engineering infrastructure can handle that request or not or how much are related to swing and how much is the latency in that one week of time since we set the optimal kubernetes Sports configurations, and after that they be testing starts.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: The interview? Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've had a significant impact at Amazon, particularly with the proactive system for detecting potential delays in package deliveries. Can you walk me through the AWS services you utilized to implement this system, and how you ensured its scalability and reliability?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So the system works such a way that we get a signal from our upstream, and then we use that signal to trigger a flow where we will determine if the it will call an ML model, and we will determine if the flow is if the package is delayed or not. So we get the, uh, we get an up, uh, invocation from our upstream using Amazon SQS where they will send a message for a particular package ID. So whenever we receive a package ID, we fetch all the details of the package, and then we call, uh, AWS Lambda is invoked whenever we get an SQL. So SQL triggers AWS Lambda, which processes the messages, and it calls ML model using Amazon SageMaker. And then after getting the model, we after getting the response, we store it in Amazon DynamoDB, AWS DynamoDB. Uh, and then at a later point of time, uh, for example, let's say on the date of delivery, we tell the customer if that particular package is delayed or not. So once, uh, so every day at 5 PM, all the packages that are supposed to be delivered on that day will go through SQS to the customers. So, for example, if, let's say, package x gets delayed to be delayed by 2 days, so we will send a notification to the customer through SQS saying that this particular package will be delayed by 2 days. Now this service is scalable because AWS Lambda, everything is serverless, so Amazon takes care of. So the whenever we get more number of messages, the AWS Lambda will scale itself to handle all the traffic, and SQS will make sure that we are doing it asynchronously so that none of the messages are deleted or are throttled and not processed. So SQS will maintain a queue of all the messages processed and unprocessed, and then AWS Lambda will scale up accordingly to do the messages. And AWS DynamoDB also scales up accordingly to ensure that all the messages are stored.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive use of AWS services for a real-time system. You've mentioned using AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SageMaker. Can you elaborate on how you handled the data flow and processing between these services, and what kind of challenges you faced in integrating them? Additionally, how did you monitor and troubleshoot the system to ensure everything was running smoothly?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So our upstream, which is a team called Mercury, there's they have an SMS at their side, Amazon SMS, and this SMS sends messages to the SQS. So to our SQS. And this SQS, whenever a message is received, it will automatically trigger AWS Lambda through an integration SDK APIs that are in built by Amazon. So we use cloud formation template, which ensures that whenever we get an SQS message, that triggers an AWS Lambda. And the business logic of, uh, of everything is in the AWS Lambda. And then whenever this AWS Lambda is invoked from SQS, it does some processing, and then it calls an Amazon SageMaker model using its APIs that are prebuilt by Amazon, uh, Web Services. So we the Lambda calls the API of SageMaker, gets the predictions, gets the output, and then it uses, again, uh, DynamoDB APIs to store the data into the DynamoDB using the write and the read APIs. So one of the major complication we faced is the size. So Amazon, uh, Lambda has a maximum size of 512 MB, And sometimes so the reason we went with SageMaker is we were initially thinking of storing the model in the Lambda itself, but the model was around 2 GB. I mean, we can we have some libraries which we can directly use to call them mobile models, but the size was 2 GB. And since this, uh, the Lambda was not able to support that much of memory, we had to use the m Amazon SageMaker. That is one of the problems we faced. And the second one was we went with SQS. Uh, we went with Lambda because ECS, there would be, uh, we tried to look at multiple other approaches using Fargate and Lambda, but we felt that the pattern was not regular. It was very regular. So to ensure that our service will be able to handle traffic at any point of time, we needed a serverless. That too, which will be easily integrate which can be easily integrated with the SageMaker, uh, the DynamoDB and the AWS SQS. That is why we went with Lambda.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you've made some strategic decisions to overcome the challenges of size limitations and the irregular traffic pattern. Given your experience with AWS Lambda and SageMaker, how did you approach versioning and deployment of your machine learning models, and what strategies did you use to ensure that the models were always up-to-date with the latest data?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Okay. So the machine learning models and are all built by separate team called applied science team. What we did is, uh, whenever we whenever we invoke, uh, so there, we we maintain a separate config called prediction config, which contains all the details of the machine. So in our case, what happened is we have a separate machine learning model for each of the shipment that used. So there can be UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHS. Each of these ship method and based on region, we have a separate model. So we maintain the config of all the machine learning models we have based on the ship method. So it is a JSON file, which map to ship method to machine learning model and the features invoked. So we use this config in AWS Lambda to ensure that the versioning is properly handled. So whenever we want to whenever we want to invoke a new machine learning model or to when we develop a new machine learning model, which is more accurate, we just change the prediction config, and the AWS Lambda will read this config, fetch the information which ML model should call, which SageMaker endpoint it should call. And then based on that, it will call a particular model. So this ensures worsening, and the AWS Lambda itself has a worsening. Whenever we deploy new changes, the functions will automatically update. So worsening of AWS Lambda is handled by AWS, and worsening of the machine learning models which are to be invoked is handled by using the prediction config.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a solid approach to managing and deploying machine learning models. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you also have experience with Java and Python. Can you discuss a complex problem you've solved using Java, and how you leveraged its features to address the issue? Additionally, how do you decide when to use Java over Python in your projects?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So recently, we came across an approach where we had, uh, ETL. So one one the problem we were facing was, uh, there are 4 tables in the red shift cluster, and we had to read 4 tables from red shift cluster and then do a combination combined process of, uh, combined process of all of combine those tables based on some particular queries and then dump this data into Adios. So the traditional approach is read one table, then process it, then read another table, then process it. So but the issue here is that almost all of them are of similar sizes, and each of them takes 1 to 2 hours to read because of their size, which is around 10 GB. 100 g. Update can go up to 100 GB. So the problem was if we do it 1 by 1 in a sequential manner, would we would have to waste around 10 to 12 hours reading the tables and then combining them, and then we'll take another 10 to 12 hours. So what we'd average here is, we we sub segregated the data into 4 since there are 4 tables, we made the classes extensible such that all of them can be called in a separate thread. So what happens is we get data for each. So at the initial whenever the service is initialized, it creates 4 flows in the first so it will create 4 flows, 4 threads to be accurate, 4 threads, and each thread will be reading the data of particular table based on at at the time of invocation, we will specify which thread will read which table, and then those threads will reach each table and then store it in RDS. And then what we do so this will reduce the total time taken by by 4 times since all of them are being done parallelly. And then once that is done, we will store all of them into an RDS. And then instead of doing the combination of combining of the tables in, you know, in service, since these are threats, we thought it will better to dump all of them in RDS. And once all the threads are completed, we will invoke the next we will invoke the next step, which will read data from RDS, combine them, and then push it again to your RDS. So one one one thing we had to do here is if we we had an option of either combining the data in RDS or reading it into a separate service and then combining them and then pushing it to ideas. The here, we have we thought of multiple things. First of all, the time was almost similar if we are trading, combining, and then sending, or if you are directed doing because of the RDS CPU capabilities. And then second thing is the money cost. So doing doing this process in RDS costs around 8 to 9 times more than doing it in a service. So we took it we took it into a Java, and then, again, did use multi threading and semaphores and all of those things to combine the data and then dump it. So here, we use the oops spin oop oops to make oops concepts to make the service loosely coupled so that all of them can be all the 4 tables can be read at the same time, and then we use multithreading to read all of them at the same time. Now coming to pipe that is our answer to your first question. Now coming to Python versus Java, we mostly go with Java because Java is much faster and much easier to, uh, code because of and most of our code base in Amazon is based in Java. So we'll try to go with Java most of the times, but in case of machine learning models and working with certain libraries like Pandas, uh, PySpark, These things, they are not they are not readily integrable with Java. So in those cases where I in those cases where speed does not matter, but only Python has the capabilities to process, we use Python. So we use Java for most of our business logic, and we use Python for any changes related to machine learning models or handling of wind data.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've effectively utilized Java's multi-threading capabilities to improve performance in data processing tasks. Your approach to decoupling and parallel processing is quite impressive. Given your extensive work with both Java and Python, how do you ensure that the code you write is maintainable and testable, especially in a multi-threaded environment? Can you also share your experience with any specific tools or frameworks you've used for testing in these languages?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So I'm going to test come coming to testing wise, uh, all of our business logic, has to be definitely tested extensively and exhaustively because these are all customer facing systems, and any impact will directly any error or any failure will directly impact the customer. So we do multiple levels of testing. Firstly, we will test everything in unit test. We use Mokito, j unit testing, Mokito. And then depending on the service, we or depending on the language, we use Google dose injection and all, uh, dose indexing for dependency, but we use all of these for testing, unit testing. And then we use cucumber, sir, cucumber for integration testing. So whenever we deploy any change, we make sure that all the unit tests are 100 there is at least 95% coverage of unit tests. And then there is an unit and then they this is the first step. And whenever we deploy in beta, we will do integration testing so that none of the existing none of the existing, uh, workloads are failing and none of the existing services impacted. So this and then in beta, again, we do a testing of manually sending signals or manually sending signals in beta and gamma. So So we do beta and gamma testing. Uh, after these four levels of testing, we are 90% sure that, uh, those are we won't face any issues. But, again, if it is really if it is, like, changing 1 if it is changing from 1 service, 1 upstream to another upstream or the changing of dependency, we have a concept of WebLab. So what WebLab does is we will have 3 treatments. But, uh, if, for example, you are changing from workflow a to workflow b, what we will do is, initially, all the services, all the process are calling workflow a. And so WebLab is basically for versioning. It will use it will call it will determine which which flow is to be called. So, initially, we will have 3 treatments. SCON c treatment will call only workflow a, not touching workflow b. And t one treatment will call workflow a and work flow b, but it will output the result of workflow a. So t one treatment is where we do all the parity testing, uh, error testing, everything. So treatment 1 will give us confidence that, yes, workflow a and workflow b are working exactly the same. There is no issue. We can move to workflow b. And then we go to t 2 treatment where we slowly, gradually dial up to t two treatment until 100%, and then we observe for some time, and then we deploy the system. So there are multiple stages of testing. 1 is the unit testing at service level, and then we do beta and gamma testing at beta and gamma environments to ensure the service is working exactly. And then there is integration testing. And then, finally, there is this dial up gradual dial up of service from one one feature to the other feature. If they if it is something like fixes or something, we don't usually go with this dialogue feature. We we get confidence based on beta and gamma testing. But if it is something like a new new dependency or the current dependency is being changed, then we do a gradual gradual deployment of the feature. So the technologies we use, like I said, are JUnit, Mockito, Jupyter, and then this is for unit testing. And then we use web labs for the gradual dialogue, and then we use Kokumba for integration testing.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to testing is very thorough, and it's great to see that you're using a combination of tools like JUnit, Mockito, and Cucumber to ensure high code quality and system reliability. The concept of web labs for gradual feature deployment is also a very effective risk mitigation strategy. Given your experience with these testing frameworks, can you tell me about a particularly challenging bug or issue you encountered in your code and how you went about debugging and resolving it?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. So recently, uh, we deployed a feature where so, like I said, we'll we're in the 1st product. We do delay alarms where we send delay, uh, alarm if alarm if a particular package is delayed. So as part of this, we recently came across we recently deployed the changes to a new ship method. And then after after almost 3, 4 months, some of the workflows we observed that some of the workflows suddenly started failing. So then we've we had to go through all the logs. So whenever we these Lambdas, what they do is they continuously give us the logs off. Uh, they continuously log all the errors, all the statements we are logging. So first, initially, we looked at the logs, and then we found out that there is one particular issue because of a time zone error. So we use join ID, and then we use time zone dot off. So these 2, uh, packages, they have conflict. And then CST, if CST is given as time zone, then these 2 have conflict and it fails. So first, we went through all the so first, we went through all the workflows that failed, and we got the package IDs, and we got the message which was initially sent. Then we went through the logs, and then we found out that this is we get coming because of this issue. Then what the next step we did is I did it this is specifically done by me. What I did is then I I created the exact replica of the production environment in data environment, and I gave multiple inputs and tested that which all cases is this failing, which all cases is not failing. So that way, I tried to determine, and then I added some additional log statements in beta environment to ensure that which flow is getting invoked. There are multiple business logics and business flows, and I wanted to ensure that which flow this was going and why is it going wrong. After all of this, we've, uh, I identified that one of the due to this latest alarm that we developed, we we had a miss where we forgot to test that. What happens if this if the existing alarm comes after this new alarm? This was missing, uh, beta testing where we were supposed to exhaustively search for all the methods, but somehow the developer did not do it correctly. And then we found out that this is being caused because of this. So then we identified what all which all we were close, which all business projects are failing because of this, and then we deployed the chain uh, we fixed the changes. You and then tested them thoroughly and exhaustively, and then deployed the change again to fix the issue.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's commendable how you tackled the issue by first analyzing the logs, then replicating the problem in a controlled environment, and finally identifying the root cause through additional logging and thorough testing. This methodical approach is key to resolving complex issues. Given your experience with debugging and resolving such issues, how do you incorporate the lessons learned from these incidents into your development process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So the first thing I did for this issue was we tried to make a list or a document of all the current use cases and how they need to be tested. So the issue the root cause for this issue was missing beta testing. And, uh, what are the different types. So, for example, if these alarms, and, uh, what are the different types. So, for example, if this alarms this does should not alarm all the use all the possible combinations of all the flows. And then what we did is we I didn't we also gave I also created a a links of all the inputs. So, for example, if there is use case a, this is the input that will give you a particular flow. This is the input that will give you a different flow. So I listed down all the workflows, all the inputs, and then I ensured that whenever I we created an SOP document, where if a particular if a new developer is adding a new workflow, he's supposed to add it in a centralized clip, so in centralized document. So all these things will ensure that then whenever a person is deploying, he will have to go through all these use cases scenarios and then use those inputs and then get output and check if everything is working as expected or not. And whenever a new developer is adding a new ship method or a new feature, he's supposed to add it into this document, centralized document. So this is one approach. And the second is ensuring that there is 100% coverage in the indication testing and 100% coverage in the unit testing. And, also, we created, uh, I suggested, and then we created a person. So for each service, there should be ownership of 1 person, and he should review all the reviews so that this doesn't affect the whenever a person new developer is creating us, uh, pull request or code review, the specified person should do the code reviews and understand why it is failing or if it will fail at any point or if it will impact any other existing. So that this will this way, we will ensure that so by having a centralized doc, we will ensure that none of them fails. And then by having a centralized person, we will know that this will not adverse. So instead of failing, there can be cases where the instead of giving a, the answer might come out output might come as b. So having a subspecific person will ensure that this a and b is also covered.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have extensive experience in IT consulting across multiple geographic locations. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you managed and how you ensured stakeholder satisfaction throughout the process?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, this was in an onshore project when I was working for a client based in Illinois. I was on-site, uh, and we were taking over the project from an exiting vendor. Uh, and we had to reproduce the entire code in pseudo format because there was no history of code because they had used Agile. So we had to scale very quickly, understand the issues, document everything, and then create solo code so that the developer could start actually building the code, uh, and replace the system and actually make it workable and efficient. In addition, we also did UI UX for a digital program that they were launching, which we successfully won later on. But we had no information, and we had nobody to give us any, uh, knowledge transfer. So we had to pretty much learn everything ourselves very quickly. So it was very challenging.\\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a complex situation. Given the lack of historical code and the need for rapid scaling, how did you approach the initial stakeholder management to set expectations, and what strategies did you employ to keep them informed and engaged as the project progressed?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Um, that's also a very good question. So I was the lead BA on that project. And at that point of time, we did not have the budget to scale. So I was pretty much the only BA on the ground. The first thing I did was I actually understood the scope of the project, and then I built out the plan, uh, on how this project can be executed. Then we componentized it. What I mean by that is I've broken down into pieces, uh, to understand, uh, the priority of the client because to create any kind of influence in such a situation that there's no historical information readily available, uh, we first had to create trust. So for that, we had to componentize it, break it down into pieces, uh, create an agile mindset with the client because quick turnarounds were expected, uh, and we could not and we did not know what we did not know. And we had to make that clear to the client so that we could show success while maintaining integrity, uh, and show some deliverable. So broke it down into pieces, client was traditional waterfall methodology kind of client. Uh, we brought in a more agile mindset. Uh, and then, uh, we started getting budgetary approval to start scaling a project. Uh, and that is how we started building stakeholder trust. Uh, the the client then intervened and got us some historical information from executive vendor because we went with a very clear plan of execution. So this is where we had to I had to also start project managing. Uh, I was actually traditional BA. This is where I started project managing. And then I started scaling the project. I brought in Jira, and I started actually breaking that work into pieces. And then we took the historical code and started breaking it into pieces. Uh, that is where our technical knowledge came in because that's where I had to use, uh, my technical know how and my subject matter expertise.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's impressive how you adapted to the client's needs and transitioned from a traditional to an agile approach. Given your experience with Jira, can you describe how you've used Jira to manage and track the progress of your projects, and perhaps share how you've utilized its features to communicate with your team and stakeholders?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So that is also a very good question. Uh, Jira was not very popular at the time I started it. It was known, but the client was very traditional in their mindset. Uh, so the first thing I did was I actually demoed the tool to them so they understood. Uh, I also showed them budgetary savings by using Jira because at that point of time, they were using human interface. Uh, they had used a human interface in the prior project because prior vendor had done that because of which they had no historical information. So first, I sold them the tool that this is what it will do for you. Uh, after that, what I did was because a lot of my team, especially all my developers, were sitting offshore, uh, I broke this work into pieces. I showed them how Jira works, how you can create a project, how you can create tasks, and then how you can build in, uh, test with it because I wanted them to start adopting TDD. Uh, so what I wanted them to do was make it deliverable in a way where the test proved the theory, uh, or the code, uh, so as to say. I also wanted integration because we were multi Geo. So I had people sitting in India across 2 or 3 different locations. These were my core developers. I had my management, which was my c suite sitting across America, uh, and 1 in metro Indian met in the Indian Metropolitan City. Uh, the client was on the ground over there, but they were also spread across 2 locations. So the tool unified everybody. Uh, this is at a time that people were not using Zoom because this is pre pandemic. And, uh, the it was a very traditional way of working. Everybody came to office, and we set vast meetings, which were 4, 4, 6, 6 hours. Now because I componentized everything and I broke everything down into understandable pieces, which were referenceable across time zones by everybody, Uh, slowly and steadily, that tool started scaling. Uh, as the tool started scaling, I started getting the budget to bring in more people because now I could prove that those people were actually doing work Instead of saying that this will take 10 days, I'm putting 50 developers on it. I could actually tag the developer to the Jira. So I broke it down into minute pieces. Uh, it was not done at that point of time, and I faced a significant amount of resistance. Uh, but because Jira does that, what was not known at that time was Jira was developing a dashboard, and they had a very decent dashboard at that point of time. Now there was a small cost that we lost. Like, a little bit of business was lost because we could have built that dashboard in Excel at that point of time and made some money, but we wanted to show the client value because we were building trust. There was an existing vendor. So we used the Jira dashboard. It became centralized because the client could see that we were more interested in giving them value rather than actually, um, you know, taking money out of them. Uh, we build tremendous integrity and trust with them. And then we will start we were able to put in a lot of extra work, uh, from a funding perspective because, of course, billing is everything. Uh, and we were able to bring in headcount. So while we lost a little bit of money in creating a dashboard, which was pre pre prepared or pre created by Jira for which we made no money, the fact that we introduced it to them, uh, got us a lot of trust points, and we built integrity with them. They actually liked it so much to scale it across the organization, uh, and we were able to show them how to use the tool up to a point after which, of course, once they started bringing other vendors, uh, we withdrew from there. Uh, but we were able to bring an extra headcount because they could see that we were only charging for what we were doing, uh, and we had a long term relation because of that.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've leveraged Jira effectively to not only manage the project but also to build trust and demonstrate value to your client. The use of dashboards for transparency is particularly noteworthy. Shifting focus a bit, you mentioned your experience with UI wireframing and UX digital customer experience study. Can you discuss how you've applied these skills in your projects, particularly in the insurance domain, and how they've contributed to the success of your initiatives?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Actually, this was a happy accident. Uh, I was actually at the client location, and I was, uh, able to, uh, make friends with many people. And I went for a user experience demo. Uh, at that point of time, user experience was primarily known in US. Of course, now because India is digitized, you can see those projects here also. Uh, but what they were doing was they were building something on a mobile phone, uh, for users because, uh, this client realized that they were not at the forefront of the customer's mind when it came to digital purchases, and, uh, they wanted to be there. So they had actually invited another vendor to do this. Uh, and I was, um, well, I was strategic enough to get invited to that, uh, uh, presentation. Uh, at that point of time, I saw what was happening, uh, and I understood that, uh, you know, they had different age groups of customers. A user experience survey is where you bring people of different age groups into your office. At least this is what this client used to do traditionally. Uh, and they would come in and they would be exposed, uh, to the POCs, The proof of concept that another vendor had created. And what I could see was that while they had done a tremendous amount of work on the UI, they had not thought about the UX part of it. Uh, and these are 2 very different things. So the end customer experience, uh, from the UX perspective was not very positive. But UI was very good because they were trying to bring in, uh, a UI which was diverse. So for people who can't read small print, uh, for people who are older, who may not be able to type as quickly, so on and so forth. As you have to understand, this is a slightly older project. Uh, now, of course, you can use voice, uh, but at that point, that was not an available function. Uh, so I saw the the the gap. And as you can see in my CV, I started my career in IT from a gap analysis perspective. So I'm trained to look for gaps. And what I understood was while the UI experience was very good, adoption was poor. And they were trying to understand why that was, and that was because UX experience across the board was very poor. And UX is, of course, completely different because you are looking at everything, usability, how the brand comes across, uh, what kind of trust it's communicating because you know you're using your cell phone, and your demographic may not necessarily be young. Uh, and as you can see, as the market is changing, the demographic is not necessarily investing in certain kind of insurance products, uh, but you want to pull them in. So you create a great design from a UI perspective. But your traditional customer actually can scale and purchase. You lost them because you're running after a younger customer, and you're losing your cash cow because you won the star. So I understood that, uh, and I was very lucky I understood that was because I was in the right place at the right time, very frankly speaking. And I understood that, and I was able to go back and document this, um, because I am traditionally a BA, and I could put my analysis in a quick snapshot. I could share it with my c suite management, and we were able to go and pitch that this is why you are not getting pickup from your core customer. Because while you are able to show great UI, uh, the UX experience is not good. And the customer drops in a million. Or they don't close once they've closed their transaction, they don't want to come back and use digital to buy your product, so they go somewhere else. So this is how I used UI UX, and I studied at that point of time. It was not an area where I had a lot of exposure. So I scaled at that point of time. I had to do it quickly because there were multiple vendors in the race. Um, but we were able to make a a good dent because we had displayed trust throughout our experience with them. They had a very good experience with us. They knew that we are not going to gouge them, basically. So we got that business.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your ability to identify and address the gap between UI and UX, especially in the context of diverse user needs and demographics, is quite insightful. It's clear that you've been able to pivot and apply your analytical skills to a new area, ultimately benefiting the project and the client. Given your experience with Agile methodologies, how have you integrated UI/UX considerations into your sprint planning and product backlogs to ensure that these aspects are not overlooked in the development process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: That is a very, very good question. Uh, so, yes, uh, it was very challenging because the back end developer will not necessarily marry with the front end developer, and the skills that are required, especially for UX design, are significantly different from people who are actually doing back end development. So we had to bring in that integration point. We had to buy that scale from the market, and we had to scale within our team. Uh, what we did in Jira was we actually broke out the tasks under a given, uh, you know, project in such a way that when we developed it, the end result of done, uh, if you follow business analysis and if you follow what a requirement means, the definition of a requirement delivery is the definition of done. So I define done very properly. That is the number one thing you require to deliver successfully. What is the definition of done? The definition of done was that the integration points between back end and front end had to be seamless. And the tests that we had put in, which a t shaped developer was required to do because that is where the market was going, uh, because traditional developers who have been trained in the last decade or decade and a half don't understand t shaped delivery. It is a concept which has been introduced now, But people who are in the market with 5, 8, 10, 15 years of experience have never done t shape delivery. So they did not take responsibility for doneness because that was pushed to the VA and the tester. So we had to bring that rigor into the Jira itself. So we connected the Jira to the actual delivery point so that when you are standing and cutting the branching gate and you're going to deliver it, at that point of time, once the code has run, once the production cycle is over and we are doing the postmortem of the release, at that point of time, we can only say it's done if it's actually working seamlessly. And that was brought into the Jira with different tasks, and we would not consider that task complete till you could prove through intensive testing. And you have to work together as developers because test budgets were being cut because developer. Uh, and some testing, you cannot use automation. You need manual ready tester. Because there was no budget, I did it. Uh, and we made sure we delivered. So once the client saw that there was a need for traditional testers, which were, uh, technical and UAT, we got the budget to bring in some technical testers manual testers.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've taken a comprehensive approach to ensure that the integration between front-end and back-end development is seamless, with a strong emphasis on the definition of done and the use of Jira to track these integration points. Your strategy to enforce TDD and the responsibility for testing within the development team is a key aspect of Agile practices. Given your experience with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, how do you tailor your communication to ensure that both groups understand the technical complexities and the business implications of your projects?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Up again. It's a very good question. It's a very challenging question to answer because every situation is different a lot depends on the maturity actually of your developer. See the product owner who will come from the functional side or the operational side is coming with a specific knowledge of what they want. They don't necessarily know how it will be done the Person who is coming from the technical side knows how it will be done but doesn't understand what it means for it to function and the functional world and sorry for the double function there. The thing that happens is I mentioned before developers have traditionally not been trained in the last decade or two things from a functional perspective, which is a core requirement of a t-shirt developer. So you have to bring that practice in and a lot of it depends on the resistance. You will get from the developer traditionally a business analyst is going to face that challenge because it is they are responsibility to ensure delivery is done and definition of done has been met and the technical skill that brings in is going to be the thing on which you are going to prove that. But for that your technical resource has to understand it. So there are a lot of meetings that are down in the starting where you bring the developer to the meeting on 199% of the time at least at that point of time because they are just interested in what has to be done. They look at the technical spec and they will go in building but now or at least that point of time so something I was doing and I didn't realize eventually I was eliminating BS from the market, but I would force my developers to come and sit over there. At least I used to make the lead. And eventually the guy was on the lady who was actually supposed to sit and go. I reached that point it took me over four months to achieve that level of trust within my own team that the person who's been assigned the jira. She comes to that meeting and understands the challenge. I will give you an example. We were doing a migration from ux to reach us who are kind of screen and developer was not interested in speaking to the end user or listening to the ba in this case me. And they will the screen in react and what they didn't realize was that the person who was using the Unix platform. They were actually using keyboard. They never touched their Mouse the operational guy never touches the mouse. And the developer did not consider that. And because they did not consider that extreme did not pass through in front of the client when we positioned for POC because they said well my operational user has to use about they don't use Mouse houses. They just report and what the developer had not thought of first thing. You should make it happen. Now I did this deliberately because this was a challenging situation. I had a everything in writing but to developer was not interested and I made the developers sit in that session and see the interaction. We were having they were not participating they were offering we did not expose our and put them in front of the client to show all this is the error it was not about finger pointing. So what explaining what the client was expecting? And then as we brought in agile processes, like I started bringing in the product owner I started. Bringing in that rigor that you have to understand what they are asking for. They will not know how to do it. That's where you come in you show how it's done. But they will only value what you have done is then it does what they want to do. And that's how I was able to build in the river. So initially you do some meetings. Now the market is more mature in my last assignment. It took me a little bit of time because this was this team was not used to Agile. But once they came and realized it was not about finger pointing or blaming and understanding what their actual requirement was. This is what you need to develop. They don't want to know how beautiful your code is. They want to know if they're going to get and once you understand the process, which I will explain and I will show you so let me Demo it first. So this is how I did it, but it took time it's there is no TurnKey solution over here. It depends how much are the team is there it is on the agile and how interested people are in growing and learning rather than costing.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders is quite strategic, emphasizing the importance of developer involvement in meetings and the demonstration of user interactions to drive understanding. It's also commendable how you've managed to instill a culture of learning and collaboration within your team. Given your experience with Agile and the challenges you've faced in introducing these practices, how do you measure the success of your Agile implementation, and what metrics do you typically use to track the team's progress and the project's health?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: There is only one and only one way in it, but they use agile whether you use waterfall whether you use any kind of system definition of done must be like if it is meant you are successful if it has not met no number of tools are going to help you. So the tools are there to help you achieve the objective. If you are going to put the tools in front of the objective, then your project will fail. You have to understand the mentality of the people you're working with because while I'm giving this interview in Ai, and I know the future is AI people are still traditionally working in teams and you have to make sure that they understand that definition of done is everything everything else is something which is going to help you achieve. Your objective agile is a tool it will only work if you are able to influence the mindset and for that you need money management support. But if you don't get it and you still have to deliver then you have to keep the focus of the team of definition of done and you have to show them that they have to partner with each other. All the agile tools whether it is the scrum ceremony, we teach everything and I have done training across all the global Level Training and rollouts by creating Frameworks and then customizing them to Deals. There is no one size fits all in agile and scrum also works differently. I have worked in teens where a scrum to 405 minutes which is unheard of because a scrubs ceremony should not go more than 1150 minutes. If you can keep it under 10, you will really well, but you need a level of maturity in the team, which is not as Be found because this is a practice you have to build rigor that takes time because you're changing people's mindsets. So I've used all agile tools, but we have to remember the tool is not bigger than delivery at the end of the day delivery is definition of done being night and product for the signing of product process. Yes, you have done it. That's it. But yes, you have to use the tools which are going to help you fashionable to use each other right now. It's fashionable to say you were scrum. But I've gone to scrum which are two hours long, which is nothing more than a status meeting. And then you have to change the mindset. It took me eight months to change the mindset of one particular team, which went from two hours to 17 minutes. And it was a journey. So we have to remember that every tool is valuable and you must use technology but point of using technology.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Interview? Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in both technology and business, with an MBA and a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication. How have you leveraged this dual expertise in your role as a Business Value Consultant at VMware, particularly in the context of enterprise projects in the Asia-Pacific region?  \\n', 'Interviewee: So and I use technology to understand the products in a better way, be it, uh, VMware, computing, or storage, or networking, and also com computing technologies that, uh, we actually use. Right? I use the engineering skills that I have to understand in a better way from from technical point of view. From my MBA background, I use consulting skills and also strategic skills to understand the business, what business is thinking, what and which direction they are going, and, uh, to better align the value solutions in terms of business objectives to, you know, to meet the end, um, perspective to showcase the value of the customer that they can derive.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach, blending technical understanding with strategic business acumen. Can you walk me through a specific project where you had to craft a transformation strategy and how you ensured that the technology solutions you proposed aligned with the business objectives of your clients?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Definitely. So the client was, uh, basically is a private data center. It was everything that they are doing in house, and they don't have any public cloud presence. So, uh, they wanted to move to public cloud, so they don't know which for which cloud they want to move, whether it is AWS or Google Cloud or Azure. So so we had quantified the data that, um, for all the 3 clouds on what what would be the pricing, and what would be the benefit, and what could be the easiest way to implement between these three clouds. So we give a comprehensive understanding and a business case for them. So so that, uh, they took a wise call to motivate a better cloud, which is AWS, which is cost effective to handle. So, you know, we choose their strategy long term rather than 4 to 5 years. So that was the one of the, you know, customer where we had, you know, very good collaboration with respect to AWS and also with the cloud.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you played a pivotal role in guiding the client towards a strategic decision that not only addressed their immediate needs but also aligned with their long-term vision. Given your experience with AWS and your role in driving Go-To-Market initiatives, how do you approach building a business case for AWS services, and could you describe a scenario where you successfully influenced a client's decision to adopt AWS through your business value consulting?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, can you repeat, please?\\n'], ['Interviewer: Certainly. With your experience in driving Go-To-Market initiatives for AWS services, how do you typically build a business case for these services when engaging with clients? Additionally, could you share an example of a time when you successfully influenced a client to adopt AWS by presenting a compelling business value proposition?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Sure. Definitely. So first, I understand the, uh, you know, business current IT capabilities, what they're currently doing, and what is the strategic direction, what's the business intended to down the line 4 to 5 years. And based on that, I recommend strategies, IQVED as options. Uh, the option will consist of, uh, various possibilities and also various ways to implement particular public cloud. So it can be directly to refactor or you can rehost or re platform the things. Based on these options, you can successfully build a complete business case, including it includes the, you know, um, ROI and also net net present value and total cost of ownership. Using all these levers, you can build a business case, uh, for the customer. And coming back to AWS, uh, I did work with multiple customers on AWS. So my approach is that, uh, first, I will, uh, understand their holistic view, uh, where they are currently heading towards and, uh, which with which market they have the huge presence, whether it is APAC market or America or EMEA. Based on these three things, I choose, uh, um, which cloud is beneficial for them. So I I go through their current arc IT architecture and understand what are the systems that they have and what could be the future systems that they're gonna need and which has the, you know, easiest compatibility with AWS. So, uh, this is the approach.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to building a business case for AWS services is quite thorough, focusing on the client's current capabilities, strategic direction, and the various implementation options. It's clear that you use financial metrics like ROI, NPV, and TCO to quantify the benefits of AWS adoption. Given your experience with different cloud solutions, how do you stay updated with the latest AWS offerings and industry trends, and how do you incorporate this knowledge into your client engagements to ensure they are getting the most innovative and relevant solutions?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Correct. So it's it's very important to get myself updated with the latest, uh, updates that is going on in AWS and also in the technology trends. So first thing is I go to their Amazon website and, uh, you know, uh, see what are what are the various product classifications and various upgrades and changes that are going on and updating my local Excel based model. I I do maintain a, you know, local model for all these things, and I update my own framework to reflect the new changes. And, also, from the technology point of view, I read the articles that are published in the, you know, technology forums, mainly from the company websites. And, also, I do the competitive assessments also. So I see, uh, how AWS is compared with the competition and check the documents and data sheets. And, also, I googled some of the things to get a better understanding to see how the technology trend is going on and follow some of the forums, uh, to get, you know, myself updated with the latest technologies.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you're proactive in keeping your knowledge up-to-date by directly engaging with Amazon's resources, maintaining your own model for tracking updates, and conducting competitive assessments. Your method of staying informed through industry publications, company websites, and forums is commendable. Given your role in driving innovation and growth, can you discuss how you've applied a specific AWS service or feature that was relatively new to the market in a client solution, and how you managed to convince the client of its value despite its novelty?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So, uh, one of the customer, uh, was into a manufacturing, uh, you know, business where they were they were building, uh, long, uh, steel rods, and they were unable to tag the inventory, uh, because they're they because in the factory, the pipes will be so deep, and we don't know in exactly how deep, um, the exact inventory was there. And the solution was to, uh, track the exact location along with the x, y, and also zed axis. Uh, it it indicates, uh, how deep uh, the, you know, the, uh, lot is there in the workshop. So based on the exact location, it's a custom built solution where based on acceleration, the trolley will pick the, exact lot and deliver to the, you know, outbound, uh, carrier.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very innovative use of AWS IoT services to solve a real-world problem in the manufacturing industry. Leveraging IoT for inventory tracking with precise location data is a game-changer for operational efficiency. How did you go about designing and implementing this solution, and what were the key considerations you had to address to ensure the system was scalable, secure, and integrated well with the client's existing infrastructure?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: So so the the main problem here was, uh, in lot of in one place getting wasted, and, uh, this was this was impacting their, uh, bottom line, uh, for the customer. So they wanted to, you know, improve the operational efficiency of this and, uh, eventually save on the inventory. So the the major problem here is that, uh, to get the, you know this is the this is the complete custom solution with the where there is no of the self solution for this. And the custom solution has to be built from scratch. And we do had some of the products, but they are not compatible because, uh, it's for the manufacturing company, and, uh, we never build such a product. So, finally, what we had done is we had identified a development team and told them the detailed scenario and build the enhancements for them. And it was scalable because it we tried for the only one manufacturing unit, and it was scaled to across, uh, all their location in different different countries. And, also, it it not only applies to in just for the for this customer, but it can also be reused for multiple customers.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's impressive how you tackled the challenge of custom solution development to address the client's unique needs, focusing on operational efficiency and inventory management. Scaling the solution across multiple locations and potentially for other clients shows a strategic approach to both problem-solving and business expansion. In terms of the technology stack, how did you ensure that the IoT solution was secure, and what AWS services did you integrate to handle the data processing and analytics for such a complex system?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So I use the for the AWS, I use the, you know, back end, uh, data, uh, which is the, um, EC 2 instance, um, which are used for the all the processing of these things. And for the IoT, local chips were used, uh, and also a card reader, uh, you know, a scanner. There is a scanner. Uh, there is a scanner on the trolley on the lot. Uh, sorry. There is a scanner on the trolley, and there is a bar code on the, you know, uh, on the lot. So the scanner on the trolley moves through the entire lot, and it scans the various systems and upgrades the updates the system, uh, data to s it's SAP ERP. And ERP will know the exact location of a particular lot. And once you steal to the, you know, um, trolley to pick a particular lot, it goes to the exact location based on taking the data from SAP and picking that data and and reading the barcode and transferring the same data back to the SAP system. So everything all so so one source of truth is SAP system, and this entire thing is integrated to the back end end cloud system, which is AWS EC 2 instance.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Integrating AWS EC2 for backend processing and SAP ERP as the single source of truth is a solid architectural choice for maintaining data integrity and security. The use of IoT devices with barcode scanning for real-time tracking is a practical solution for inventory management. Given the critical nature of the data being handled, how did you implement security best practices within the AWS environment, and what measures did you take to ensure that the communication between the IoT devices and the cloud was both secure and reliable?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So for the security purposes, uh, I had used the VMware NSX and also Carbon Black, uh, which is deployed on top of, uh, AWS. For on AWS, it is NSX, VMware NSX. And for the you know, for transmitting from IoT devices to the back end system, it's carbon black. It's basically, uh, what whatever the data it transmits, right, it's a bit it's it's bit it's basically implements 0 trust, um, methodology, uh, to filter everything that comes in the way and doesn't assume that, uh, uh, data is already secured. It, uh, it follows the zero zero trust, uh, methodology and secure the data.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Implementing VMware NSX and Carbon Black on AWS is a robust security strategy, especially with the emphasis on zero trust, which is essential for IoT environments. This approach ensures that all traffic is inspected and verified, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data flow. Can you elaborate on how you configured NSX to provide micro-segmentation and how this helped in isolating and securing the different components of the IoT network within the AWS infrastructure?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Definitely. So, uh, the micro segmentation, one of the critical part is the, you know, uh, east west traffic and also north and south traffic. So the both traffics has been assessed. Uh, one is 80%. The remaining is 20%. So, uh, the majority of the traffic is within the company and, uh, which is, um, uh, east and west. So so in the micro segmentation, uh, if whenever, uh, whenever, uh, whenever a particular, uh, cell is, uh, corrupted or infected with some wrong data, that cell will be isolated, and, immediately, a trigger will be trigger will will be sent to the back end security team saying that particular cell has been, uh, you know, malfunctioning or corrupted or there is some issue with the particular cell and it doesn't transfer the data east or west, And that particular cell will be automatically, you know, um, uh, just, uh, adjusted and resolved to, you know, to function back normally. And, uh, this is how it is being implemented.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Micro-segmentation with VMware NSX is indeed a powerful tool for securing East-West traffic and containing potential threats. The automated isolation and alerting system you've described is a key feature for maintaining the security and integrity of the network. Given the complexity of such a system, how do you ensure that the implementation of micro-segmentation does not impact the performance of the IoT devices, and what monitoring tools or practices do you use to keep track of the network health and performance post-implementation?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So one of the thing that was that that was used as, uh, uh, observability, which is, uh, VMware uh, product, uh, to monitor the all the security things. And, uh, second thing is we took the assistance of professional services team, uh, which is from VMware to implement the system and better integrate the data and also IoT devices. And, also, uh, we also con uh, you know, we also engaged with the telecom provider, uh, to better, you know, understand the, you know, data, uh, so better understand the bandwidth and also, uh, how the bandwidth services are there for the manufacturing company. So that's it.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging VMware's observability tools is a smart choice for maintaining visibility into the network and ensuring that the micro-segmentation is not causing any performance issues. It's also good to hear that you worked closely with Professional Services and the Telecom provider to optimize the system. In terms of future scalability and potential new features, how do you plan to evolve this IoT solution, and what role do you see emerging technologies like 5G playing in enhancing the capabilities of such systems in the manufacturing sector?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Correct. Currently, the customer order they're using. Right? They have an in house solution. And, also, everything was updated locally in the data center. But when they expand to multiple countries on multiple region, if they scale up the manufacturing process becomes bigger, right, then they no longer can use the, you know, on prem data center. Rather, they have to go to a public cloud or a, you know, um, updating the things, I know, uh, via wireless technology, and 5 g plays an important role. And, uh, so the technology that we have built is compatible with 5 g as well to, you know, to to adapt to, you know, speeds of 5 g and also infrastructure that we have given, right, which is Amazon Amazon e AWS. So it is also compatible with the latest technology. So we can definitely see that, uh, the company the customer can benefit from expansion on with the whatever the whatever locations with these new technologies.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you've considered the future scalability and the need for a transition to a more distributed and wireless infrastructure, especially with the potential of 5G technology. The compatibility of your solution with 5G is a forward-thinking approach that will certainly benefit the client as they expand globally. As you look ahead to integrating 5G and further enhancing the IoT ecosystem, what are some of the key challenges you anticipate in terms of infrastructure readiness, security, and the integration of new technologies, and how do you plan to address these challenges?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So some of the techno some of the, you know, the security issues are if they are on the go, the if the end users are on the go and if they want to use, uh, uh, scan the things through mobile or if they want to update a lot through mobile, then there's a issue because, uh, uh, the mobile phones are used here, and we are not sure whether they're properly em encrypted or not. So further the solution is, again, you know, to use a device encryption, which can be from VMware, uh, device encryption. There are mobile device encryption from VMware. Uh, we have many digital, uh, workspace solutions, um, which are on mobile or end user end user computing, which we can use, uh, to secure the device. The other thing is that, uh, once, uh, once the solution is stabilized, uh, with 5 g and, uh, we need to we need to have the infrastructure also, uh, we support you of, uh, what we are using. It's not just in one manufacturing. It should be across all the manufacturing unit. So the solution here is to, um, uh, understand from the customer, uh, the their direction and and also, uh, whether, uh, whatever the telecom provider that they have tie up with, uh, to see, uh, whether we can, uh, integrate our, uh, whatever technology stack that we choose, uh, with them or not or to see how this goes, uh, to from the tech security point of view, from from the scalability point of view.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: You've highlighted some critical concerns, such as the use of mobile devices and the need for robust security measures like device encryption. Leveraging VMware's digital workspace solutions for end-user computing is a strategic move to ensure security and manageability. The challenge of ensuring infrastructure support across multiple manufacturing units is indeed complex, and aligning with the client's direction and their existing contracts is a prudent approach. As you work towards integration and scalability, how do you plan to test and validate the new infrastructure and security measures, and what kind of collaboration will be necessary with the client's IT teams to ensure a smooth transition and ongoing support?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: First I will undertake a pilot project or a pilot implementation for one manufacturing date ensure that everything is you know working as per the you know detailed specs. And also I will take a sample size for the end users and for them. I will give you the encrypted devices and also the whatever the target operating model is and test them test the scenarios there and see how they are how it is going and if the successful in the pilot, then it will Implement across all the location different roads based on the region.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Morgan to enhance the risk management capabilities of the OTC desk at CoinDcx?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Some of the skill set that I, uh, apart from JPMorgan were about the model building, uh, specifically around the pricing of the pricing of the things. For example, BTC, uh, does not follow a typical, uh, normal distribution or a or a black shows model. We use something called SVCJ, stochastic volatility correlated jump, to price in, uh, options on BTC. Although we didn't trade options at 0.86, but, uh, information in options were were pretty much relevant there. The other things that I sort of, you know, uh, helped other thing that helped me here at Point ECX in Quant was, uh, my experience with order books. So a lot of time because Point ECX is is a stand alone, uh, exchange in India. Uh, Indian market sort of operate differently from the rest of the world. There is some sort of, uh, premium that goes on in here. Liquidity is a bit different. So trading those, uh, liquid illiquid options and payers, uh, understanding of them sort of help me here build those strategies, uh, to sort of, you know, exploit the alpha and, uh, get the ball rolling for the team. Uh, although I say alpha and get the ball rolling for the team, most of the work eventually that we ended up building were, uh, market neutral and, uh, market making strategy rather than alpha exploiting. Given\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the non-normal distribution of BTC and the focus on market-neutral strategies, how did you adjust your model to account for this, and what were some of the key challenges you faced in implementing this non-standard modeling approach in a practical trading environment?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, issues that we faced, uh, effectively, what happened is, uh, BTC let's say, in an international market, a BTC USD or a BTC USD pair, in itself, modeling that is a bit difficult. But, uh, there are no liquidity challenges there. Uh, modeling it there is sort of like introducing a jump parameter in our modeling of, let's say, simple black shows or a, uh, stochastic, uh, black shows equation. And then maybe we can go from there. Uh, but a challenge that Indians or Indian market would face is, uh, it's built upon a upon a stable coin premium. So you have to, uh, account for that. So that that requires, uh, 2 form of understanding of things. 1 would be a stable coin premium plus the underlying, uh, underlying b t BTC issue. Now to tackle those challenges of the non normal distribution, uh, we sort of had a look at the actual BTC prices or the actual BTC auction prices that is where they are at. Uh, so compared with normal, what we have observed at BTC distribution, uh, compared to a normal or a bell curve is is is sort of, like, longer, uh, at the center, but thinner at the center, and the tails are thicker. So what it means is BTC doesn't move much, but when it does, it does, uh, jump a lot. So we just made a few changes in our strategies accounting for that. Uh, one example would be that, let's say, when I'm trading, uh, for market meeting, and if the spreads are normally in a in in in a very stable or a mature market, the spreads change basis volatility when our market making would would largely follow some form of normal distribution. But at Bitcoin, the spreads, uh, versus volatility, uh, at a very low volatility, we could keep, uh, spreads lower and make money. But as soon as, uh, volatility increased slightly, the spread that we adjusted for were pretty high. So this is an explanation for the thing, uh, for the change in the normal distribution of Bitcoin, uh, versus a traditional asset wherein, you know, the the the the tails are thicker and the centerpiece is thinner and longer. Your\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your detailed explanation highlights the complexities of modeling and trading BTC, especially in the context of market dynamics and liquidity variations. How did you quantify and manage the stablecoin premium and its impact on trading strategies, given its significant influence on certain pairs?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, we have a pair called USDT INR, Tether INR, which is, uh, the most liquid in Indian markets. Uh, what we had come to realize is the the stable coins premium with, let's say, a dollar INR, uh, value is is is function of, uh, three things, basically. 1 would be your regulatory enrollment. So whenever there is some form of, like, regulatory uncertainty or people who want to exit, uh, crypto market in general, uh, that premium sort of shrinks. The other would be, uh, whenever, uh, there is demand to buy BTC in India relative when I say demand to buy, relative to the rest of the world. For example, there may be a selling pressure in the, uh, rest of the world, but let's say the selling pressure or the selling volume or the selling intensity is Indian low. In that case, that premium would expand because it makes sense for people to actually buy USDT and then use that USDT to sort of, like, buy, uh, BTC. So that premium is sort of like a vote on India's propensity to hold, uh, crypto in general versus the rest of the world. Uh, and adjusting for some form of regulatory and the friction in moving, uh, money around. So let's let me give an example. Let's just say the regulatory and the friction. Like, uh, INR is one way convertible currency. Uh, that, uh, regulatory friction and the other thing, let's say, it account for 2 and a half percent premium. Anything more than 2 and a half percent in my model or in my trading, I would attribute it to the India India population's propensity to hold cryptocurrencies in general. So that sort of, like, is the word on that. Uh, one of the example is whenever there were regular regulatory uncertainties in India about banning crypto or, uh, stuff like that, uh, a year or 2 back, uh, this this actually premium turned into a discount. It traded below the INR, uh, USDT market. So there are qualitative aspects and quantitative aspect both in managing that premium of stablecoin. Under\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the factors influencing the stablecoin premium in the INR market is crucial for effective trading strategy. How do you approach the integration of qualitative and quantitative factors into your models or trading decisions, especially in situations where qualitative aspects may not have clear numerical representations?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, this is wherein, uh, we had, uh, we took help from Offshik. This is wherein, uh, they we they they, with the health analytics, had built some form of scraping from Twitter and other things. And, uh, we adjusted our parameter based on those, uh, feedbacks. But everything qualitative, uh, whenever we cannot quantify we could not quantify it, uh, had to be sort of, you know, tinkled with parameters manually. Whenever we could quantify it, for example, if the premium is going down, uh, we know that, you know, the demand, uh, for BTC, uh, in India is, uh, compared to the rest of the world, is slightly less. We can, uh, sometimes, uh, you know, uh, go short on a BTC thing. If if premium is expanding pretty aggressively, we could go long on BTC because everyone is going long. But a lot of those qualitative factor, which cannot be quantified since you asked about non quantifiable qualitative factor, I had a whole, uh, team of traders. Uh, think of those traders as a sell side bank test wherein they run their OTC desk. So we had inventory and warehousing of things, and those qualitative factors were taken care by my team from that part of the team. So I had 2 teams. 1 who was doing solely quantitative stuff. The other were discretionary trader, uh, who sort of would take care of, uh, qualitative aspect for the team.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Integrating sentiment analysis from sources like Twitter is innovative for adjusting trading parameters. How do you ensure the reliability and accuracy of these qualitative inputs, especially when they're used to adjust trading strategies significantly?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, we didn't use we didn't we didn't rely on Twitter significantly, uh, specifically for, let's say, our mainstream points. Uh, whenever there was now to make sure that, you know, the the the sentiment analysis or, uh, whatever we are doing, why Twitter is not giving up on, What we did is, uh, we sort of looked at the real world signal as well. For example, when there was, uh, BTC, ETF news, there were a lot of preemptive sentiment, uh, on on Twitter, which had to be checked with other, uh, mainstream news sources as well. So once our Twitter thing, uh, is there, if we we didn't go all in on the trade, we just, uh, were sort of, like, cautious and, you know, maybe initiate a little bit of trade and be, uh, be ready to, you know, get a bit, uh, higher quantity trading in in in in the market. But once as soon as the news is, uh, sort of, like, confirmed by one thing or the other, uh, we sort of, uh, jumped into a trade. So Twitter was just one of our parameter. Uh, sentiment from website scraping and other thing is just one of one of one of the parameter. Then have very large weight. Uh, it become important around certain, uh, turning point in the market. This was not always relevant. For example, when there's a huge sell off, uh, when, uh, when there is a very large open interest, let's say, around, uh, option expiry or even there is when the funding rate between futures and BTC, uh, b BTC spot is pretty high. In that case, we we felt that, you know, uh, this could be relevant. Under normal circumstances, that didn't play much into our trading. Given\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of qualitative factors in your trading strategy, how do you envision leveraging AI or machine learning models to better incorporate and perhaps even automate the adjustment process based on qualitative inputs?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Input that option he needs to do. Uh, I think it's pretty easily, uh, uh, can be pretty easily handled by, uh, by an AI model. For example, a lot of scraping that is done is simply a code, uh, which can be scrapped. This is that, uh, an AI model can simply, uh, sort of, you know, uh, have some form of qualitative score score, something like a greed or a fear index that we have for equity market. That sort of index can be built by an AI model, which obviously can be refined as, you know, uh, it gets trained over more data, uh, to to figure that out. How that reacts, how that greed and, uh, fear index once we have derived that greed and fear mix via AI, how that is leveraged, uh, with the actual actions in the market. For example, when the market is pretty much, uh, to the greed side, and let's say, uh, how how are the jumps looking? So in that case, my assumption this is how we did it qualitatively was every downward down should move down jumps were pretty, uh, aggressive and swift, but the up moves were, uh, sort of, like, drifting in nature. So that sort of thing with AI can pretty easily be done. I think, uh, the whole qualitative aspect of things current pretty much, uh, the level that we were doing can pretty much be automated by an by an AI. The only place I think human, uh, touch would be required is via the experience or, uh, the parameters of the area that AI is not looking at. Because, uh, as I said previously, there are times when one factors are, uh, you know, very important as compared to the other. So PB and AI would probably take time on training, shifting from one driver to the other driver. That's the only challenge AI would face with regard to, uh, qualitative factors. So AI plus sort of like an human observer, uh, is pretty much, uh, something that can be replaced whatever we were doing with, uh, our strategies. Consider\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Considering the potential for AI to handle qualitative aspects, how do you plan to ensure the interpretability and transparency of these AI models, especially in an industry like finance where understanding the \"why\" behind a decision is crucial for trust and risk management?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Start, uh, one one way to build trust, uh, especially in in an in a Fintech or a finance sector would be to have an, uh, human observation. Maybe you can, uh, over a period of time. The second thing is backtesting the AI itself, like, which, uh, which are the turning points. Just like any other program or any other coding, uh, things, I think there are gonna be tail cases. Uh, identifying those tail cases could be pretty important. Again, uh, this is very in a very large set of data, at testing things, where the things are going haywire, uh, can come into the picture. We can add a layer of, uh, permission, uh, if AI based decisions are there. For example, not going beyond, uh, certain things, and we can have a strict stop loss. So my point is we already have, uh, CTAs or algorithmic trading, right, uh, built into the system. And AI is sort of, like, expanding that domain with lot of qualitative factors, uh, maybe quantifying them into, uh, an, let's say, a greed or fear index or some form of rankings, uh, to sort of, uh, enhance those. So just like our, uh, algorithmic trading or height, uh, high frequency trading has happened, has evolved over a period of time, it doesn't always make money. Sometimes there is a need for a human observer to make sure the risks are, uh, managed correctly. But, uh, AI greatly enhances, uh, the abilities of that human observer wherein, you know, the datas are readily available, uh, to be to be seen, like, what's the exposure and, uh, the other things. How do you\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you envision the role of AI in dynamic risk management systems, especially in terms of its ability to identify and respond to emerging risks in near real-time?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Be really interesting. Like, a lot of risk management that happens are rule based in in financial firms and other places. For example, when your leverage goes beyond these things and, you know, like, focusing on sudden risk, for example, currently, I would say, uh, Israeli run risk. I think a lot of equity managers would be or crypto managers would be paying attention to. These are all, uh, I mean, pretty much, uh, lot of things that are done by human can be done by AI. And lot of decision makings, which are simply rule based. Uh, lot of those decision makings are if then else in nature. For example, this is the risk. We calculate bar and we say that, hey. We need to reduce the risk. And then this is where in in AI, which, let's say, our trading program can come into picture and opportunistically can reduce the position. Keep an eye for the hedges if so a lot of, uh, these things at at least at at older or, you know, of of of of traditional houses that happens, most of it are if then else, uh, system monitored by a human being. So that is, I'm guessing, pretty much easily automatable, uh, by by an AI. The benefit with AI as compared to a traditional coding would be, uh, the longer it can run, the longer the better it can get trained, uh, which probably was not there with the traditional, uh, coding or something like a conditional, uh, coding, uh, previously. As\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: As AI systems learn and adapt, how do you propose to manage the potential for AI to develop unexpected behaviors or strategies that may not align with the intended risk management goals, especially in complex and interconnected financial markets?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So for example, this is not a new problem, to be very fair. Uh, this problem, I think when we started, uh, I think when I say we, when humans started, uh, with the algorithm trading, this was there with algorithm trading as well. How do we manage, uh, the sizes of the position, the leverage, or the the adverse, uh, potential of losses? And this is wherein we we came up with a rule based system. We came up with, uh, systems wherein, you know, limiting the AI in certain cases. So I think those conditions can automatically be in built. Uh, I don't see it different than a human trading. For example, when a trader a human trader is taking position, there are certain limits on it. You cannot go beyond this risk. You cannot take this many positions. Uh, the net position or the net d v zero one or sensitivity or whatever drivers cannot be higher than this one. This can be sort of, like, uh, implemented within AI system as well. The other thing is at least till the time AI is training, we can have, uh, 2 order of, uh, sort of, like, uh, lock locking mechanism wherein, you know, once, uh, if something goes on in the first order, the second, uh, code or a second form of a technology can take care that, you know, the systems are, uh, working properly as in, you know, uh, the strategy stops there itself. We have in I've got in trading as well today. Uh, let's say if your losses go beyond a certain limit, the the strategy, squares off everything, stops for a while, sends a notification to a a trader or a manager, sending them, he takes the further decision. So lot of, uh, the problem that, uh, we we discussed are, uh, sort of existing for a volume trading as well and, uh, taking care of there as well. How do you\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you plan to ensure that the AI systems remain transparent and auditable, especially in the context of regulatory requirements and the need for stakeholders to understand and trust the decisions made by these systems?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: System or, uh, like, decision making system, the logs for the same should come in handy. Today so this is equivalent to, uh, SCC regulation for, you know, banks to to have those communication happening through community challenge so that when whenever that happens, those, uh, communication can be audited that were sort of, you know, useful, uh, especially in things like lab or stand alone, nothing. Same way a lock of actions of, uh, of AI decisions can be maintained, uh, wherein a lock can have the action and the reason for the action. And then let's say a size of the trade and, uh, stop loss and take profit for the for for all the things. And, uh, that logs can be updated, uh, with the decision. For example, you had a trade and the logs should be updated, like, why did you took, uh, take profit? Why did you change something? What are the relevant details that has happened? So, uh, a log can have, uh, sort of, like, a water flow model wherein, uh, one scale would be sort of like the summary, the list of the trades, and other thing. You can click on that rate to see, like, what were the basic detail. And then just like a blockchain, it can have other details, like, uh, during the life cycle of trade, what what all things had happened. And, uh, if there are losses, like, uh, one one can have another look, what could have been done well, and, uh, what would, uh, ideal situation would have demanded, when should have the book losses. So, uh, sort of like a equal into a blockchain ledger, you can have a decision making ledger for a for an AI, for regulatory requirement, and for the transparency. Like, whatever has been done, why it has been done. Thanks.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: To start the interview? Yes. Absolutely.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in finance and accounting, with significant experience in leadership roles. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging financial analysis you've conducted and how you approached it?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Absolutely. So, um, I'll draw on my most, uh, one of my most recent experiences as director of finance at a, uh, series a food start up food tech start up called Food Rocket. Whenever I joined them, they did not have a, uh, an internal person running finance, and, uh, I had to build their three statement operating model from scratch. One of the challenges was that they were on a cash basis accounting, um, and at the request of their series a investor circle, um, circle k, they, uh, needed to, you know, switch over to accrual based accounting. So, uh, I had to actually go back, uh, from the accounts payable side of things and, um, reconcile, uh, receipts, uh, to the bank statements for fiscal year 2021 in order to have the, um, you know, the correct inputs to build, you know, to build the model, um, on an accrual basis. So, um, that took a lot of time. It was very, uh, very challenging, but, you know, I ended up, uh, building that over about a 2 and a half month period of time. And, um, I think in the end, our, um, our investors were happy, and and so, uh, so was our, um, you know, our, uh, executive team.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a complex transition, especially with the shift to accrual accounting. Given your experience with financial modeling, can you discuss the tools or software you used to build the three-statement operating model and how you ensured its accuracy and reliability?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yeah. Absolutely. So, um, combination of tools. At Food Rocket, specifically, we, uh, used a Tableau, um, for our BI and for data. And then the model that I built was built in Microsoft. So a lot of the times, you know, with the, uh, collaboration or with the, um, you know, uh, help of our head of data, I would pull various reports from Tableau and then, uh, build the model or update the model in Excel, um, based off that that data that was provided to me. So that's that's primarily, um, the 2 tools that that, you know, I used or that we used to to inform our model and build it.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear how you integrated Tableau for business intelligence with Excel for modeling. Given your role as a fractional CFO at Straff Consulting, where you were responsible for building relationships with the executive team and board, can you describe a situation where you had to present complex financial information to non-finance stakeholders and how you ensured they understood the implications?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So, um, at Stratify, this was a little bit different than Food Rocket, uh, considering that I was not an internal or I am not, um, an internal finance employee. Rather, I'm, um, you know, uh, consulting as a fractional CFO. And, um, I think I think one of the things, and this is ironically one of the things that, um, I've been working on in terms of deliverables for that executive team, uh, is, uh, reporting and, um, KPIs and defining those metrics that matter and, um, being able to, uh, present them in a, um, easily digestible manner for the leadership team. And, um, most recently, uh, we actually had our January monthly reporting call, and I took after meeting with a lot of the stakeholders across various departments of of the client's business. Uh, I took them and organized them into, uh, you know, organized a lot of the data, um, and the reports into, um, you know, pivot tables, histograms, uh, pie charts, uh, time series, uh, based, um, cross sectional line graphs, and, uh, condensed the narrative around, um, just high level bullet points, uh, so they could be easily understood by management, um, within no more than than 30 seconds of of seeing them on a slide.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very strategic approach to distilling complex data into actionable insights. Given your experience with KPIs and metrics, can you share how you've identified key performance indicators for a business and how you've used them to drive decision-making and strategy?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Absolutely. I think, um, I think, really, the thing to consider is, first and foremost, you need to understand the business that, uh, you're either working in or advising, uh, knowing intimately, you know, on a, uh, vertical or industry stand from an industry standpoint, uh, what are the, uh, what are the metrics that are important to, uh, uh, not only stakeholders, um, internally, but also your competitors and, um, investors that invest in your space. Right? So I think, um, I think for me, that's that's the first step. And then I think, uh, there's also some other, um, um, there's also some other factors that that go into making that determination around KPIs. I think, you know, more recently given the shift in the macroeconomic climate, which has, um, you know, been not exactly as favorable, uh, for technology and, um, you know, what I work in. Um, I think that, you know, you'll see things like, uh, focusing on, uh, more efficiency in in profit you know, profitability based KPIs, uh, versus growth. Uh, KPIs is something that, uh, is contextual, uh, given the you know, as I alluded to, the the macroeconomic climate. A perfect example of this is I think a lot of, um, a lot of companies and a lot of investors in tech were focused on this growth at all cost, um, type of mindset and approach. Whereas, um, you know, now, um, you know, thing things like, um, ARR. Right? How how fast you're growing, um, you know, revenue, um, you know, how fast are you, uh, acquiring new new customers. But now, you know, I think things like dollar retention are coming into the fray where, um, you know, customer acquisition costs now are higher than ever. Um, and, you know, if you're able to, um, you know, upsell and expand and land your your current customer base, um, while also, uh, you know, uh, focusing on reducing the amount of cash that you burn is is something that I think, um, is is maybe more relevant from a KPI standpoint, uh, than it was 2 or 3 years ago.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Absolutely, the shift in focus from growth to efficiency and profitability is quite significant, especially in the tech industry. Given your experience with early-stage fundraising, can you walk me through your approach to financial modeling for a startup, particularly how you balance the need to show growth potential with the current economic challenges and the focus on efficiency?  \\n', \"Interviewee: yeah, so, you know, I think that um where I had the most experience doing this was that food rocket whenever we raise our 25 million dollar series a from Circle K Venture arm and then was also a part of turning around three months later. In focusing on raising a 100 million dollar series B. one of the things that I that I you know was keeping in mind was that obviously we had very ambitious plans for growth in I built a model that I built a ProForm of that was showing this growth from 2022 while I was there, you know through the end of 2025 so that you know, three year three year model not as building as a part of this this fun race and you know, one of the things that we were cognizant of cognizant of and that I was aware of that I think was going to resonate with investors was okay, you know, yes, you're you're expanding your your moving from a handful of geography as we were operating into let's say A 15 or 20 new ones across the United States, right and revenue is growing significantly year over year, but do you really have do you really have the unity economics figured out of the business right? Because I think investors at that time during that shift they went from hey, this is really a cool novel idea to you know, it has a lot of growth potential to what is your contribution margin look like you know, what what when are you going to be profitable right on a On a net profit margin basis because you know at the end of the day, I think if you can prove out at least at some of your legacy, you know stores which we had. Our most mature markets that hey, you know this store which is our first store or this second store, which is our second, you know, whichever one can be actually profitable on unique not the basis. Then you have a stronger you have a stronger buy-in from external stakeholders, you know, primarily investors and that you're going to be able to have a successful overall outcome for the company to you know reach that profitability.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very strategic approach to financial modeling, focusing on unit economics and contribution margins to demonstrate the path to profitability. Given your experience with building and maintaining a data-driven financial model at Hirehaq, Inc., can you elaborate on the specific data points or metrics you found most valuable for informing your financial decisions and how you ensured the accuracy of the data being fed into your model?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So Hirehack, um, was admittedly a little bit of a different, um, scenario than some of the ones I've already spoke to. Uh, I was actually a cofounder of HireHack, uh, which was a b to b, um, uh, interviewing software, ironically, since we're on an interview year. Um, and we were very early stage. We raised a $500,000 precede round from friends and family. And I think really our focus was more on, um, you know, marketing, uh, spend, uh, customer acquisition costs, uh, trying to analyze and make sure that our, um, you know, our channels that we were spending on were, uh, basically giving us the highest ROI per that spend. And so, um, you know, a lot of the process for us was just making sure that, uh, any reports that we were analyzing were standardized. The data was, uh, was clean. Uh, we could, um, you know, have a significant statistically significant, um, set, uh, to rely on, And in terms of ensuring that that, uh, data was accurate, we, um, you know, we would we would we would basically back test and check it against, um, what we were seeing in terms of, um, you know, our, uh, our number of customers that were coming in, the new, uh, customers that we were acquiring, um, what channels that they were truly coming from, and then, you know, uh, reconciling those, uh, those 2, um, not on a manual basis, but, you know, building uh, building various checks, you know, using, um, utilizing technology specifically. Um, one of my favorite things is to to is to use, you know, formulas in Microsoft Excel to be able to, um, kind of drive that process in terms of, um, data, uh, data integrity.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that you have a hands-on approach to data integrity and a keen focus on ROI when it comes to marketing spend and customer acquisition costs. Given your experience with building and maintaining data-driven models, how do you approach the challenge of forecasting in a startup environment where historical data might be limited or less reliable, and what techniques do you use to mitigate the risks associated with such forecasting?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. You know, I think, um, I think there can be 2 scenarios, right, for for early company, you know, given given the life cycle, um, you know, where where they are in that company life cycle, whether it's, you know, let's say pre seed or seed or, you know, if if the company's a series, um, e or d pre IPO, rdore rather pre IPO. I think that, yeah, those things are those things are very, um, those things are very different. And I think that, because of that, the forecasting is most certainly, um, more challenging. You do have less data points. But I do think that the good news is is that if you internally, um, don't have a lot of data to draw on, the good news is that, you know, there are more than likely plenty of, uh, comparables. Uh, there's probably no shortage of either current startups or past startups that, um, you know, have been in the scenario that your startup's in. There's, um, plenty of great data out there from a rel you know, on a relative basis, um, plenty of, you know, uh, top top tier venture capital firms, uh, that put out really great reports and that at least can give you, uh, can give you an idea if you don't have that internal historical data. And a lot of the times I have I have turned to those. Um, you know, one that sticks out to me in particular is, um, Bessemer Venture Partners. Um, I know a partner over there. Uh, he's provided me a lot of, um, really great, uh, you know, industry and stage specific, um, uh, reports, uh, for other startups that are in similar, um, industries or at similar stages in their in their company life cycle. And it's been extremely helpful to, um, to sort of use that as a, uh, you know, as a north star to rally around in in terms of my own my own forecasting and, uh, financial modeling.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Leveraging industry reports and comparables from top-tier venture capital firms is indeed a valuable strategy for early-stage forecasting. Given your experience with these external data sources, how do you ensure that the assumptions you make in your financial models are both realistic and justifiable, especially when presenting them to potential investors or stakeholders?  \\n', \"Interviewee: That's a great yeah. I mean, that's a great question. I mean, I think, um, the old adage, uh, goes when it comes to modeling and your assumptions is, uh, garbage in, garbage out, uh, for for your model. Right? So your your model can be as as fancy, uh, or as complex, um, as you wanna make it, but, uh, is it gonna be right or, um, valuable, uh, you know, whenever that future point in time comes that you're forecasting, that's sort of, uh, to be determined, and that is, um, you know, obviously predicated on the assumptions that you're making. So, um, you know, for me, I think that one of the great things to do is, um, is to use scenarios. Doing scenario analysis, doing, um, sort of a, you know, base case and then, um, a blue sky scenario, not just relying on, um, just one set of assumptions can be really helpful, um, because I think in the end, uh, I always like to say that it's not a matter of if your model is gonna be wrong. It's, uh, how, uh, less wrong it's going to be, um, versus the, uh, the actual reality of of of what happens in in in the future of the business. So so, yeah, for me, that's, um, that's, uh, something that I've really relied on and, um, you know, being able to sort of, you know, plan for or at least forecast for, uh, various, uh, different levels, um, of outcomes, uh, uh, has been a has been a valuable, um, has been a valuable exercise in my experience.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Absolutely, scenario planning is key to demonstrating a thorough understanding of the potential outcomes and risks. When you present these scenarios to investors or stakeholders, how do you communicate the level of confidence you have in each scenario, and what kind of sensitivity analysis do you typically include to show the impact of different variables on the forecasted outcomes?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Well, you know, again, I think it really all depends on, you know, the quality of your comparables data. You know, I mentioned, um, the industry reports, uh, from from vest from Bessemer. They fortunately usually include, you know, 100 or thousands of companies in their reports or, um, you know, if I have if I have the historical data, um, you know, I'll kind of rely on both those to convey, you know, convey my confidence. I think at the end of the day, I'm a very data driven person. Um, I don't just build expectations and say, okay. You know, I think that, um, the economy is gonna be great next year, and it's gonna be a tailwind. And then I'm gonna, you know, be super confident on that basis alone, uh, when it comes to conveying to, uh, investors and other stakeholders. So so I think it's really just a matter of staying, uh, um, convicted by the data that I'm using. Uh, I also have a background in statistics, so I think, um, leveraging that is definitely a way that I convey, um, you know, convey confidence um, to, you know, internal, external stakeholders, whether it be\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great to have you here! I see from your resume that you've worked on a variety of financial projects, including a $350 million project for a petrochemical company. Can you walk me through how you approached the valuation for such a large project and the key factors you considered?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Thank you very much. So in 2021, right, I worked on a project for an oil and gas company, petrochemical company that was looking to raise 350 k u, $350,000,000 on the time of financing, like, a large, project. Right? In terms of working through the valuations, right, I had consider so many, key informations around, market volatilities. The commodity prices as well, in addition to that, like, regulatory environment here in Nigeria. Right? As of then, I have to look at building, like, the feasibility study for the project as well just to ensure that it's a project that would ultimately have a benefit that that that's sort of feasible and ultimately doesn't have any sort of issue at the end of the day. That was the way I approached it.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach. When you mentioned considering market volatilities and commodity prices, how did you incorporate these factors into your financial model to ensure the project's feasibility under different scenarios?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. Yeah. So in order to be able to look through, like, the different price and models, right, and how it's gonna be volatile and also have an impact on the, the financial model. What I did was to be the case of a simulation around, like, various scenarios around, like, the price into but considering the fact that the company is based in Nigeria, so I had to use, the the the brand pricing, information. Right? Create the simulation in terms of, what's it called? A benchmark of what we're looking at, or in terms of increase in pricing and what would be like when there's a decrease in those prices. And, ultimately, how is that gonna actually affect, like, an our ability to to generate returns on the project as well? Also, consider the likes of looking at the ROI of the project, what is, like, the, what's it called, debt service coverage ratio as well, and, ultimately, what is, like, the payback period for the, in in order to pay back the loan that we actually obtained to, for the project to actually go live well. So I actually have to incorporate this one using the scenarios on on the model as well.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you used a robust approach to assess the project's financial viability under different conditions. Shifting focus a bit, could you elaborate on the specific methodologies or tools you used to conduct the Monte Carlo simulation for the project's financial model, considering the unique challenges of the Nigerian market?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. In terms of what the simulation, I did not use a multi color simulation actually. Right? For in terms of risk management part But, however, in terms of looking at it, I used, what's it called, a a pest two model, more or less, like, assessing the political, economic, to show technology, the, other, sort of risk and pass as well to the particular project. Right? So, I mean, that those are the kind of way through which I looked at it. Right? So I didn't use a Monte Carlo simulation. Specific to, this particular project. I used the best to model. I also did, like, a sports analysis, framework rather to actually assess the problem.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given that you used a PESTLE analysis and a SWOT analysis for risk assessment, could you delve into how you quantified the qualitative aspects of these analyses to integrate them into the financial model effectively?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. So some of the qualitative information that I had to assess was so as of at a point in time, right, the particular petrochemical company, I was trying to build a model for actually have, like, a bit of, like, off take cars on some of the, because they were trying to build a, refinery provider that could ultimately produce, like, the likes of Pluto, but a petroleum product. Right? So they, so some of the they had, like, key partner agreement with some of the key stakeholders here in Nigeria and other African countries. Right? That sort of helps to feed out, like, in terms of the production capacity and the ability to be deliver, I mean, those products to the end buyers. Right? Which ultimately helps me to, being able to, like, have more confidence in terms of where we're in projections. Right? In terms of other key areas as well, I mean, the company, I add them actually in terms of, like I mean, they had, like, what's it called, very strong focus on, like, ESG as well, right, in terms of social economic impact and also, like, strong relationship with the government, which ultimately have an impact in terms of being able to, like, I mean, assess the that sort of reason sort of help them to mitigate it because they already have that strong point as well. So, however, like, I mean, we have a very strong promoter as well for the business. Who has a very strong well, that guy's experience, over 20 years experience in the feed. Right? So that also means we have to provide a sort of, like, technical experience and ultimately have to provide, like, a bit of confidence in terms of projections right into the future for the business as well.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's evident how you integrated qualitative factors like strategic partnerships, ESG focus, and leadership experience into your financial model. Considering the emphasis on ESG, could you detail the specific metrics or frameworks you used to quantify the social and environmental impacts of the petrochemical project, and how these were reflected in the financial model or the overall investment proposition?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So in terms of the ESG methodology, right, for, the petrochemical company, so some of the key things that I I use is, the typical, like, ASU meter methodology, which is, like, the SDG. Right? So in terms of access seeing, like, the project, so, I looked at, what's it called, the light of the measurements of the some of the key keypad that needed to track, like likes of the greenhouse, gas emission, the energy consumption and efficiency as well. Right? The safety of, employees, right, and also, like, other sort of safety measures that we also need to take into conservation, like, a case of severe cases of the work case incident as well. In order to also prevent, like, pollution of the environment, we also had to integrate a different method to which the company grows mainly add value for the various companies where, those hoists were actually, like, refined Right? To ensure that, like, there's a bit of, like, communal, like, development in this area by providing, like, I mean, educational support to this environment as well, integrating, like, very interesting, like, labor parties And in terms of, like, integrating them to and also, like, ensuring that we have a mix of both a very strong, board. Right? The That works means you have an impact on the business entity as a whole. So how does it sort of, have an impact on the model Right? So so some of the kitties that I mentioned, earlier is that I said what's it called? Right? Having a strong robust team members of SME team have an impact on how the company is ultimately gonna generate returns over time. Right? Some of those key things I actually have to consider is, like, what would be, like, the investment cost right, in terms of, like,\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Given the detailed approach you've described, particularly with the ASU meter methodology and the focus on community development, could you explain how you quantified the financial implications of these ESG initiatives within the financial model? For example, did you directly link reduced greenhouse gas emissions to cost savings or revenue generation, and if so, how was this relationship modeled?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: So yeah. So so how it sort of relates, right, it's a case of, what's it called? So local, the, the other community developed these are basically, like, some of the key cause that we actually actually have to, like, what's it called, account for, right, while starting the project, or that sort of, like, incident of, like, work accident and stuff like that. We actually had to project it for, like, I mean, terms of cost, utility bills, by looking at other cost saving methodologies like, adopting, like, more solar as opposed to using, like, typical, like, where in Africa, we struggle with our generative in North America. In terms of, what's called revenue enhancement like that, we also had to consider, like, other, environmental, conscious consumers which would obviously benefit from, like, our product as well. Also, we also have to allocate, like, what's it called, looking at all the sort of ESG risk factors, right, to actually introduce, like, sustainable parties and ultimately as long term prospect as well. So those are the ways to which it sort of have an impact on the financial.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to linking ESG initiatives to both cost considerations and revenue opportunities is quite insightful. Shifting the focus a bit, I'd like to explore your experience with financial modeling. Could you discuss a particularly challenging aspect of a financial model you've built, how you identified the issue, and the steps you took to resolve it?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. So, so in terms of the financial model, so I think it was when I was working on, a potential acquisition for a company in Mozambique. Right? Some of the key challenges that I sort of experienced in building financial model was because of the fact that the company actually has, like, different line different products line. Right? And at that point in time, they sort of experiencing, like, a bit of shift in terms of business model, like, because Right? So I had to, like, go out to follow Lukearts how this business is, right, integrate to the target company we're looking out for because, I mean, they have a different different business model. Right? And, obviously, it had to be, like, an m and a model. Some of the key things that you look out for is to segregate, like, business model that totally different from my clients that we try to look for, potential acquisition opportunities. Right? And, ultimately, some of the key challenges that we had to experience was in terms of negotiating with some of these key stakeholders around, like, valuations. Right? Also, expressed issues around, like, cultural differences and stuff like that. Considering the fact that the US had, like, an issue of, like, license at a point in time. Right? Which they do not have a very strong grip framework, in place in that area. Right? So some of those key things also have an impact in the valuation of the company. So I had to look for different opportunities in the space, speak to regulators in that market, and, including lawyers well, and ultimately, use this sort of information and feed into the financial model, which ultimately, therefore, to negotiate in terms of what we're looking at in terms of valuation for the company as well. And, also, ensuring that both parties is prepared for both, for the buyer and the target company.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: We will now move onto the second half of the interview. This section of the interview will consist of a case study based on your present work experience. Are you ready to start? \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's dive in. Imagine you are working as a financial advisor for a mid-sized renewable energy company that is looking to expand its operations. The company is considering acquiring a smaller competitor that specializes in solar energy solutions. The acquisition is valued at around $50 million. Your task is to provide a comprehensive financial analysis and valuation to support this acquisition decision. To start, can you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem? \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: So can I repeat the question?\\n\\n'], ['Interviewer: Of course!

Your task is to provide a comprehensive financial analysis and valuation to support this acquisition decision. Can you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. So to provide, the financial analysis, I think, we'd obviously have to look at, what's it called? Sort of, like, first of all, like, what are the, revenue points right How do this, solar energy company actually make money? So which is, a very key important aspect of this word as well. Right? It also consider, like, strategic fees for us. Like, how does this actually aligns with business model. Right? So what I'm gonna do, obviously, is to look the historical, financial statement of this company, right, which is, like, the target company, and look at, like, the different to another operational spare expenses and, like, profitability metrics as well. And ultimately uses, information to obviously project to the future. Alright? Number 1 with revenue Which forecast looked like based on the energy generation forecast? The OpEx, like, likes of maintenance and insurance, looked at, like, sort of, like, what's the CapEx need. Right? So, some of the time, there might be need for them expand to, like, a new facility. Right. I also need to consider, like, sort of other areas around regulatory risk is where I also feed them into the model in terms of, like, changes in government incentives or tariffs. What are the, what's it called? Like, the tariff as well in terms of performantigration or, like, solar panels. Sort of, like, market risk as well, like, in terms of fluctuation in energy prices where so after I do consider all those things, I also have to do, like, the valuation, like, the DCM, plus that the weak factor that I mentioned. I also do, like, a comparable analysis operating market analysis by considering the price per megawatt capacity revenue multiples of similar, solar companies, and ultimately make a financial decision based on what I'm gonna gain from I mean, whatever valuation I'm able to derive from this, both the comparable companies around this year.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That sounds like a solid approach. Let's break it down a bit further. You mentioned starting with the historical financial statements of the target company. What specific financial metrics or ratios would you prioritize in your analysis to get a clear picture of the company's financial health? \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: You yes. So in this deal, what's the some of the key ratios I'm going to consider are, like, financials, like, what's it called? Profitability ratios, like the net, profits margin. Right? Revenue, growth. Right, year on year revenue growth. Some of our key metrics, and we don't prioritize as well is the debt service coverage ratio as well of this project, more or less like the it's also called, like, the EBITDA divided by the total debt service that comprises of the interest on the principal repayment is where Also, like, the ROI, all those parts of our project, company rather. The, the operating margin of this business, the debt to equity, so because we all try to look at, a company that is more less leverage in terms of, like, the capital structure, right, which you ultimately because when you have to leverage levered, right, it's going to actually have an impact on, like, financial risk and have ability to generate, like I mean, pay too much of money on, based on the company's cash flow, based on the debt they're taking on as well. What are, like, the asset turnover as well? Like, feedback periods were for this project and sort of, like, around. That's sort of the key, which is our work, ultimately consider as well.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Those are excellent metrics to focus on.

What do you foresee as the main obstacles in conducting this financial analysis and valuation for the acquisition? \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Okay. Yeah. There are various, obstacles that I would likely occur. Right? I think one of them is around, like, negotiation around what the typical evaluation will look like. Right, which we ultimately are based on, like, other qualitative and quantitative impacts. Any, factors rather So one of them is around, like, the a regular creative environment. Right? In an environment where there's, like, changing government policies, right, which obviously will have an impact on the financial analysis as well. And revenue stream for the business and ultimately feed into, the projection of the company and the valuation. So one of that thing is also variability in energy production. Right? In the case whereby, like, there's there's a high fluctuation in terms of energy production, and, which will ultimately be due to weather condition here especially in Nigeria. Yeah. This will obviously have an impact on the provision some other things around, like, what's it called? Rapid technology advancement. In solar panel efficiency and storage technology, which might render the current equipment outdated and less competitive as well. That also have an impact as well. So, I mean, you also wanna consider, like, how frequently are these company growing in the respect to technology and also ensuring that, like, they're solar panel are actually much more efficient. Some of the other things, need to also become to that, like, environmental impact, right, and how it's ultimately fit into the project timeline. Right? Negotiating with the community, and also, like, increase that also have an impact to, like, the increase in developmental cost as well. Right? So more that ones it depends on on another one is around contact counterpart risk, like, depending on off the cars or under, like, a long term, purchase power purchase agreement, which will obviously have an impact on the credit risk and potentially have an impact impact on the, the projection of the company. The capital structure is one of the key issues that might my experience and volatility in the market as well. And it's changed rates and currency, risk is also one of the key risk that I know to be considered as well. Thank you.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: You've identified several important challenges.

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. I'm ready. Great.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've had significant experience in both quantitative finance and managing trading desks. Can you walk me through how you've balanced these two aspects in your role at CoinDcx, particularly in terms of the strategies you've implemented to manage risk while maximizing returns?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, at CoinDCX, I set up that point division and the OTC desk from scratch. Uh, the strategies that I have, uh, built, uh, were built by me along with, uh, the developer who reported to me. Uh, coming to the balancing part of it, since I was also adding the OTC desk because I do have a stable experience in discretionary trading as well. Uh, so this is where in, uh, font was leveraged, uh, there as well. So it was a pretty good balance there as well. Uh, quantitative skill set came from my internship and my work at JPMorgan in their contribution. Uh, so leveraging those, I sort of build a symbiotic relationship between OTC and, uh, Wandersk at, uh, find DCX. And, yeah, that's pretty much it. It's\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's impressive how you leveraged your experience in both discretionary trading and quantitative finance to establish the OTC desk. Can you elaborate on the specific quantitative models or tools you brought over from your time at J.P. Morgan to enhance the risk management capabilities of the OTC desk at CoinDcx?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Some of the skill set that I, uh, apart from JPMorgan were about the model building, uh, specifically around the pricing of the pricing of the things. For example, BTC, uh, does not follow a typical, uh, normal distribution or a or a black shows model. We use something called SVCJ, stochastic volatility correlated jump, to price in, uh, options on BTC. Although we didn't trade options at 0.86, but, uh, information in options were were pretty much relevant there. The other things that I sort of, you know, uh, helped other thing that helped me here at Point ECX in Quant was, uh, my experience with order books. So a lot of time because Point ECX is is a stand alone, uh, exchange in India. Uh, Indian market sort of operate differently from the rest of the world. There is some sort of, uh, premium that goes on in here. Liquidity is a bit different. So trading those, uh, liquid illiquid options and payers, uh, understanding of them sort of help me here build those strategies, uh, to sort of, you know, exploit the alpha and, uh, get the ball rolling for the team. Uh, although I say alpha and get the ball rolling for the team, most of the work eventually that we ended up building were, uh, market neutral and, uh, market making strategy rather than alpha exploiting. Given\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the non-normal distribution of BTC and the focus on market-neutral strategies, how did you adjust your model to account for this, and what were some of the key challenges you faced in implementing this non-standard modeling approach in a practical trading environment?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, issues that we faced, uh, effectively, what happened is, uh, BTC let's say, in an international market, a BTC USD or a BTC USD pair, in itself, modeling that is a bit difficult. But, uh, there are no liquidity challenges there. Uh, modeling it there is sort of like introducing a jump parameter in our modeling of, let's say, simple black shows or a, uh, stochastic, uh, black shows equation. And then maybe we can go from there. Uh, but a challenge that Indians or Indian market would face is, uh, it's built upon a upon a stable coin premium. So you have to, uh, account for that. So that that requires, uh, 2 form of understanding of things. 1 would be a stable coin premium plus the underlying, uh, underlying b t BTC issue. Now to tackle those challenges of the non normal distribution, uh, we sort of had a look at the actual BTC prices or the actual BTC auction prices that is where they are at. Uh, so compared with normal, what we have observed at BTC distribution, uh, compared to a normal or a bell curve is is is sort of, like, longer, uh, at the center, but thinner at the center, and the tails are thicker. So what it means is BTC doesn't move much, but when it does, it does, uh, jump a lot. So we just made a few changes in our strategies accounting for that. Uh, one example would be that, let's say, when I'm trading, uh, for market meeting, and if the spreads are normally in a in in in a very stable or a mature market, the spreads change basis volatility when our market making would would largely follow some form of normal distribution. But at Bitcoin, the spreads, uh, versus volatility, uh, at a very low volatility, we could keep, uh, spreads lower and make money. But as soon as, uh, volatility increased slightly, the spread that we adjusted for were pretty high. So this is an explanation for the thing, uh, for the change in the normal distribution of Bitcoin, uh, versus a traditional asset wherein, you know, the the the the tails are thicker and the centerpiece is thinner and longer. Your\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your detailed explanation highlights the complexities of modeling and trading BTC, especially in the context of market dynamics and liquidity variations. How did you quantify and manage the stablecoin premium and its impact on trading strategies, given its significant influence on certain pairs?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Uh, we have a pair called USDT INR, Tether INR, which is, uh, the most liquid in Indian markets. Uh, what we had come to realize is the the stable coins premium with, let's say, a dollar INR, uh, value is is is function of, uh, three things, basically. 1 would be your regulatory enrollment. So whenever there is some form of, like, regulatory uncertainty or people who want to exit, uh, crypto market in general, uh, that premium sort of shrinks. The other would be, uh, whenever, uh, there is demand to buy BTC in India relative when I say demand to buy, relative to the rest of the world. For example, there may be a selling pressure in the, uh, rest of the world, but let's say the selling pressure or the selling volume or the selling intensity is Indian low. In that case, that premium would expand because it makes sense for people to actually buy USDT and then use that USDT to sort of, like, buy, uh, BTC. So that premium is sort of like a vote on India's propensity to hold, uh, crypto in general versus the rest of the world. Uh, and adjusting for some form of regulatory and the friction in moving, uh, money around. So let's let me give an example. Let's just say the regulatory and the friction. Like, uh, INR is one way convertible currency. Uh, that, uh, regulatory friction and the other thing, let's say, it account for 2 and a half percent premium. Anything more than 2 and a half percent in my model or in my trading, I would attribute it to the India India population's propensity to hold cryptocurrencies in general. So that sort of, like, is the word on that. Uh, one of the example is whenever there were regular regulatory uncertainties in India about banning crypto or, uh, stuff like that, uh, a year or 2 back, uh, this this actually premium turned into a discount. It traded below the INR, uh, USDT market. So there are qualitative aspects and quantitative aspect both in managing that premium of stablecoin. Under\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the factors influencing the stablecoin premium in the INR market is crucial for effective trading strategy. How do you approach the integration of qualitative and quantitative factors into your models or trading decisions, especially in situations where qualitative aspects may not have clear numerical representations?  \\n\\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, this is wherein, uh, we had, uh, we took help from Offshik. This is wherein, uh, they we they they, with the health analytics, had built some form of scraping from Twitter and other things. And, uh, we adjusted our parameter based on those, uh, feedbacks. But everything qualitative, uh, whenever we cannot quantify we could not quantify it, uh, had to be sort of, you know, tinkled with parameters manually. Whenever we could quantify it, for example, if the premium is going down, uh, we know that, you know, the demand, uh, for BTC, uh, in India is, uh, compared to the rest of the world, is slightly less. We can, uh, sometimes, uh, you know, uh, go short on a BTC thing. If if premium is expanding pretty aggressively, we could go long on BTC because everyone is going long. But a lot of those qualitative factor, which cannot be quantified since you asked about non quantifiable qualitative factor, I had a whole, uh, team of traders. Uh, think of those traders as a sell side bank test wherein they run their OTC desk. So we had inventory and warehousing of things, and those qualitative factors were taken care by my team from that part of the team. So I had 2 teams. 1 who was doing solely quantitative stuff. The other were discretionary trader, uh, who sort of would take care of, uh, qualitative aspect for the team.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Integrating sentiment analysis from sources like Twitter is innovative for adjusting trading parameters. How do you ensure the reliability and accuracy of these qualitative inputs, especially when they're used to adjust trading strategies significantly?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, we didn't use we didn't we didn't rely on Twitter significantly, uh, specifically for, let's say, our mainstream points. Uh, whenever there was now to make sure that, you know, the the the sentiment analysis or, uh, whatever we are doing, why Twitter is not giving up on, What we did is, uh, we sort of looked at the real world signal as well. For example, when there was, uh, BTC, ETF news, there were a lot of preemptive sentiment, uh, on on Twitter, which had to be checked with other, uh, mainstream news sources as well. So once our Twitter thing, uh, is there, if we we didn't go all in on the trade, we just, uh, were sort of, like, cautious and, you know, maybe initiate a little bit of trade and be, uh, be ready to, you know, get a bit, uh, higher quantity trading in in in in the market. But once as soon as the news is, uh, sort of, like, confirmed by one thing or the other, uh, we sort of, uh, jumped into a trade. So Twitter was just one of our parameter. Uh, sentiment from website scraping and other thing is just one of one of one of the parameter. Then have very large weight. Uh, it become important around certain, uh, turning point in the market. This was not always relevant. For example, when there's a huge sell off, uh, when, uh, when there is a very large open interest, let's say, around, uh, option expiry or even there is when the funding rate between futures and BTC, uh, b BTC spot is pretty high. In that case, we we felt that, you know, uh, this could be relevant. Under normal circumstances, that didn't play much into our trading. Given\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of qualitative factors in your trading strategy, how do you envision leveraging AI or machine learning models to better incorporate and perhaps even automate the adjustment process based on qualitative inputs?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Input that option he needs to do. Uh, I think it's pretty easily, uh, uh, can be pretty easily handled by, uh, by an AI model. For example, a lot of scraping that is done is simply a code, uh, which can be scrapped. This is that, uh, an AI model can simply, uh, sort of, you know, uh, have some form of qualitative score score, something like a greed or a fear index that we have for equity market. That sort of index can be built by an AI model, which obviously can be refined as, you know, uh, it gets trained over more data, uh, to to figure that out. How that reacts, how that greed and, uh, fear index once we have derived that greed and fear mix via AI, how that is leveraged, uh, with the actual actions in the market. For example, when the market is pretty much, uh, to the greed side, and let's say, uh, how how are the jumps looking? So in that case, my assumption this is how we did it qualitatively was every downward down should move down jumps were pretty, uh, aggressive and swift, but the up moves were, uh, sort of, like, drifting in nature. So that sort of thing with AI can pretty easily be done. I think, uh, the whole qualitative aspect of things current pretty much, uh, the level that we were doing can pretty much be automated by an by an AI. The only place I think human, uh, touch would be required is via the experience or, uh, the parameters of the area that AI is not looking at. Because, uh, as I said previously, there are times when one factors are, uh, you know, very important as compared to the other. So PB and AI would probably take time on training, shifting from one driver to the other driver. That's the only challenge AI would face with regard to, uh, qualitative factors. So AI plus sort of like an human observer, uh, is pretty much, uh, something that can be replaced whatever we were doing with, uh, our strategies. Consider\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Considering the potential for AI to handle qualitative aspects, how do you plan to ensure the interpretability and transparency of these AI models, especially in an industry like finance where understanding the \"why\" behind a decision is crucial for trust and risk management?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Start, uh, one one way to build trust, uh, especially in in an in a Fintech or a finance sector would be to have an, uh, human observation. Maybe you can, uh, over a period of time. The second thing is backtesting the AI itself, like, which, uh, which are the turning points. Just like any other program or any other coding, uh, things, I think there are gonna be tail cases. Uh, identifying those tail cases could be pretty important. Again, uh, this is very in a very large set of data, at testing things, where the things are going haywire, uh, can come into the picture. We can add a layer of, uh, permission, uh, if AI based decisions are there. For example, not going beyond, uh, certain things, and we can have a strict stop loss. So my point is we already have, uh, CTAs or algorithmic trading, right, uh, built into the system. And AI is sort of, like, expanding that domain with lot of qualitative factors, uh, maybe quantifying them into, uh, an, let's say, a greed or fear index or some form of rankings, uh, to sort of, uh, enhance those. So just like our, uh, algorithmic trading or height, uh, high frequency trading has happened, has evolved over a period of time, it doesn't always make money. Sometimes there is a need for a human observer to make sure the risks are, uh, managed correctly. But, uh, AI greatly enhances, uh, the abilities of that human observer wherein, you know, the datas are readily available, uh, to be to be seen, like, what's the exposure and, uh, the other things. How do you\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you envision the role of AI in dynamic risk management systems, especially in terms of its ability to identify and respond to emerging risks in near real-time?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Be really interesting. Like, a lot of risk management that happens are rule based in in financial firms and other places. For example, when your leverage goes beyond these things and, you know, like, focusing on sudden risk, for example, currently, I would say, uh, Israeli run risk. I think a lot of equity managers would be or crypto managers would be paying attention to. These are all, uh, I mean, pretty much, uh, lot of things that are done by human can be done by AI. And lot of decision makings, which are simply rule based. Uh, lot of those decision makings are if then else in nature. For example, this is the risk. We calculate bar and we say that, hey. We need to reduce the risk. And then this is where in in AI, which, let's say, our trading program can come into picture and opportunistically can reduce the position. Keep an eye for the hedges if so a lot of, uh, these things at at least at at older or, you know, of of of of traditional houses that happens, most of it are if then else, uh, system monitored by a human being. So that is, I'm guessing, pretty much easily automatable, uh, by by an AI. The benefit with AI as compared to a traditional coding would be, uh, the longer it can run, the longer the better it can get trained, uh, which probably was not there with the traditional, uh, coding or something like a conditional, uh, coding, uh, previously. As\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: As AI systems learn and adapt, how do you propose to manage the potential for AI to develop unexpected behaviors or strategies that may not align with the intended risk management goals, especially in complex and interconnected financial markets?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: So for example, this is not a new problem, to be very fair. Uh, this problem, I think when we started, uh, I think when I say we, when humans started, uh, with the algorithm trading, this was there with algorithm trading as well. How do we manage, uh, the sizes of the position, the leverage, or the the adverse, uh, potential of losses? And this is wherein we we came up with a rule based system. We came up with, uh, systems wherein, you know, limiting the AI in certain cases. So I think those conditions can automatically be in built. Uh, I don't see it different than a human trading. For example, when a trader a human trader is taking position, there are certain limits on it. You cannot go beyond this risk. You cannot take this many positions. Uh, the net position or the net d v zero one or sensitivity or whatever drivers cannot be higher than this one. This can be sort of, like, uh, implemented within AI system as well. The other thing is at least till the time AI is training, we can have, uh, 2 order of, uh, sort of, like, uh, lock locking mechanism wherein, you know, once, uh, if something goes on in the first order, the second, uh, code or a second form of a technology can take care that, you know, the systems are, uh, working properly as in, you know, uh, the strategy stops there itself. We have in I've got in trading as well today. Uh, let's say if your losses go beyond a certain limit, the the strategy, squares off everything, stops for a while, sends a notification to a a trader or a manager, sending them, he takes the further decision. So lot of, uh, the problem that, uh, we we discussed are, uh, sort of existing for a volume trading as well and, uh, taking care of there as well. How do you\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: How do you plan to ensure that the AI systems remain transparent and auditable, especially in the context of regulatory requirements and the need for stakeholders to understand and trust the decisions made by these systems?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: System or, uh, like, decision making system, the logs for the same should come in handy. Today so this is equivalent to, uh, SCC regulation for, you know, banks to to have those communication happening through community challenge so that when whenever that happens, those, uh, communication can be audited that were sort of, you know, useful, uh, especially in things like lab or stand alone, nothing. Same way a lock of actions of, uh, of AI decisions can be maintained, uh, wherein a lock can have the action and the reason for the action. And then let's say a size of the trade and, uh, stop loss and take profit for the for for all the things. And, uh, that logs can be updated, uh, with the decision. For example, you had a trade and the logs should be updated, like, why did you took, uh, take profit? Why did you change something? What are the relevant details that has happened? So, uh, a log can have, uh, sort of, like, a water flow model wherein, uh, one scale would be sort of like the summary, the list of the trades, and other thing. You can click on that rate to see, like, what were the basic detail. And then just like a blockchain, it can have other details, like, uh, during the life cycle of trade, what what all things had happened. And, uh, if there are losses, like, uh, one one can have another look, what could have been done well, and, uh, what would, uh, ideal situation would have demanded, when should have the book losses. So, uh, sort of like a equal into a blockchain ledger, you can have a decision making ledger for a for an AI, for regulatory requirement, and for the transparency. Like, whatever has been done, why it has been done. Thanks.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have experience with technical consulting and data analysis. Can you tell me about a specific project where you utilized Azure and SQL to drive data analysis and how you leveraged these tools to achieve your project goals? \\n', 'Interviewee: Can you tell me about a specific project where you utilized Azure and SQL to drive data analysis, and how you leverage these tools to achieve your project goals? Yes. Of course. Predominantly, I have worked as project manager and business analyst, uh, throughout my career. Uh, so in my past career where I, uh, used to work as a CRM consultant, mainly a functional consultant alongside that being the project manager, Uh, there are a lot of information related to the service module. And, also, along with that, there are information about the sales module as well. So combining the these informations, we had to fit the data into a spot file, which is, uh, known as the reporting factory, where all the information has be are being translated into meaningful dashboards using Power BI. So there, I have used, uh, my analytical skills to come out with different terms of, uh, you know, implementation of dashboarding because, uh, you know, my client being a giant steel manufacturer across Europe, they had different kind of, you know, uh, complaints coming from their customers. So, uh, based on the category of the complaint, based on the resolution type, based on the monetary settlement, uh, these were a few of the highlights that I can think of on top of my head. Alongside that, there are different situations where we had to project sales for the upcoming quarter. And, uh, also, we had to show different information based on uh, quarterly, monthly, and annual revenues. So these are the various aspects where I used, uh, you know, uh, the analytical skills to manage the data in terms of, uh, making them into meaningful dashboards. And alongside that, being a business analyst is always gives you an uh, added flavor of using the database because there are certain certain situations where you just need to, uh, provide some support to your, uh, customer immediately. So my tool was a customized CRM application, uh, at the initial phases. So at that point of time, various, uh, customer requests came. And, uh, to handle that, I had to use the, uh, SQL, uh, in order to write in general queries, like, you know, not very critical, but sometimes some nested queries to fetch the right information. Like, uh, in past 3 weeks, how many complaints are being launched, uh, which are mainly due to the product quality issue, things like that. And, uh, also, uh, situations where they wanted to, uh, get some information about the monetary payment that has been made to the client for a specific time period and, uh, uh, against which complain how much money was, uh, you know, uh, sent to the customer in terms of, uh, credits. So, uh, in order to get those information from database, I had to write few, uh, you know, uh, basic SQL queries.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It sounds like you've had a rich experience in utilizing data to inform business decisions and improve processes. Given your role in managing the transformation of procurement processes with AI and blockchain technology, could you elaborate on how you approached stakeholder management during this transformation, and how you ensured that the project aligned with the strategic goals of the business? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Uh, this is my most current, uh, engagement that I am currently being part of. I'm working as a functional consultant, business analyst, as well as the project manager for the, uh, for this particular project. So our client is a coal manufacturing company, which is an Indian PSU. And, uh, what they want to do is, at various points, uh, they want to purchase certain items, uh, for their minds. But, uh, at that point of time, there are very little time in their hands so that they, uh, other than going for an open tender, they go for a direct purchase. So there are 2 problems major problems alongside that, uh, especially, uh, due to the direct purchase, there is less power to the buyer. That means my client. So the seller, the amount they quote, they need to pay that. That is one problem. And the second thing is the, uh, issue with the quality. So what we are trying to do is, currently, we are building a bot, uh, that is going to be installed to our client system. And, uh, at any point of time, any, uh, you know, authorized user, if he or she wants to summon that bot, they can just activate that, uh, and it will continuously check on the back end side of their SAP system because they are they're having SAP as their ERP system implemented. So it will have a continuous check on the back end to identify which are the critical items that are going on a low inventory. So, uh, there is no specific rule, uh, that if we if we go below that point, then it is considered as the the low inventory. No. It's not like that. What we are doing is we are analyzing the consumption of that particular inventory for past 4 years. And based on that, we are trying to come to a point, uh, at where this, uh, item was again ordered, you know, for a fresh purchase. So based on that, we are identifying, uh, the, you know, low inventory point for each in an individual item that, uh, the that our client buys. And based on that, it will show them in the, uh, display that these are the items that are running low inventory so that, uh, with a click of one button, uh, the there will be a web crawling that is happening at the back end. It will search the item in the Google. And, uh, if there is any seller, uh, and that, uh, sellers generally, these are big machineries, uh, or dynamized things like that. So, uh, obviously, there will be registered, uh, you know, uh, companies who are selling those. So based on those companies' website, they'll fetch the contact information. They'll prepare a comparative study that, uh, based on three parameters, the price, the proximity, and the delivery time, uh, these are the best suit for your product to purchase. And there will be an automated email system, um, so that by one click, a query email will be directly triggered to the, uh, helpline email ID. Also, in the display, there will be the contact information in case the, uh, representative of my client wants to call that, um, you know, company directly. So that can also happen. And alongside that, the system will monitor the responses that it is, uh, receiving, uh, from the seller side. So once all the responses are collected because in the in that email, there will be a time frame. There will be, uh, stipulated, you know, format attached. And once all the receipt, uh, all the, uh, replies are being received, then, again, the system will do an analysis, and it will create a competitive study to identify and suggest who would be the best person, uh, with whom they can create this, uh, uh, you know, they can go go on for that purchase. But alongside that, there is one more, uh, thing that will be coming up in phase 2. That is the moment, uh, the the our client wants to, uh, you know, float a tender, then, uh, that tender can be floated, uh, using the AI bot in the gym portal, which is a, uh, official, uh, you know, tender floating, uh, uh, you know, website here in India.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a very comprehensive approach to streamlining procurement processes using AI and automation. With such a complex system, how did you ensure that the user acceptance testing (UAT) was thorough and reflective of real-world scenarios, and what was your strategy for managing any resistance to change from stakeholders who were accustomed to the traditional procurement methods? \\n\", \"Interviewee: That's a very interesting question, I I must say. I'll go for for the, uh, second part first. That is, uh, to challenge the mindset of the users who are currently, you know, working in a PSU and for a long period of time, and they want to go for the, uh, you know, general purchase rather than going for an automated, uh, AI based solution approach. So it is important to, uh, make them understand what tangible benefits they'll get out of it. So what we are planning, me and, uh, the the CEO of our company, we are planning to host a meeting, uh, before the UAT period starts because right now, the, uh, whole bot is in the development process. So what we are trying to do is we will have a few sessions so that we can show them that what kind of tangible benefits they'll get out of it. Because even if, uh, you know, uh, a manual purchasing process takes them half a day, Uh, the whole process can be done maybe by 15 minutes, uh, by using this AI tool or AI bot. So, uh, we need to make them understand that saving, uh, at least, uh, you know, 4 and a half hours, 4, uh, hour 45 minutes of, uh, per, uh, you know, purchase, uh, is gonna benefit them immensely because they can utilize that, uh, you know, time into elsewhere. And alongside that, uh, we need to make them understand how easy it is because, uh, we will provide them some demo, some show and tell session to collect feedback also. Because, uh, unless and until we get it get into the real life scenario, uh, it is difficult for the, you know, team to understand that what kind of challenges we might face. So these these are the strategies that we are gonna implement in order to challenge the traditional mindset of the of the users. And, uh, to the first part of the question is, uh, regarding the UAT. Yes. It is it is really very important to do a smooth UAT, but, uh, it doesn't matter how critical you think or how analytical you think. Being a project manager or a business analyst, uh, there will be certain limitations to, uh, run through the whole UAD process. Because the feedback that comes from the client side, the the people who are actually getting their hands dirty while doing these kind of activities are very, very critical in my opinion. So, uh, what I need to do before, uh, you know, designing the test cases, I want to, uh, sit repeatedly along with the, uh, different parts I mean, uh, different departments of the, uh, of the client side to gather as much information as I can. Because, uh, unless and until I gather more information, the test, uh, you know, scenario designs, like, the test case design will not be comprehend, uh, you know, comprehensive enough. So I need to sit with the client side and different depart department departments of it, uh, in a in a regular interval to collect feedback. And from there on, I'll create my test test case scenarios and then get that test case scenario verified. And it is important to, uh, keep, uh, the negative scenarios as much as much as possible. Because during SIT and UAT, it is our aim to aim to try to break the system so that when we go live, the system works, um, you know, 100%. And, you know, as we are implementing machine learning and it is an AI based tool, so it is it is very important the machine keeps on learning. So the that that process is there. But at the initial phase, it is very important to design the test cases, uh, you know, after getting a help from the business users and also get the test cases verified from the business users or the clients.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to stakeholder engagement and UAT is very hands-on and user-centric, which is crucial for the success of such projects. Considering the technical aspects of your role, how do you ensure that the AI bot's performance metrics align with the business objectives, and could you describe the process you follow to monitor and report on these metrics to the stakeholders? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Definitely. So, uh, it is important to maintain the, uh, you know, AI matrix. And, uh, the moment an AI bot is is, uh, in the building process, at a certain phase, we are going to do the unit testing, and we will try to collect the, you know, results out of it. Because at as we are implementing machine learning and there will be scope of improvement at a at a future, uh, you know, point of time. But we cannot lift it, uh, on the the machine learning part itself, Uh, during every UT phase or every, you know, unit testing phase, we need to collect, uh, the feedback from the bot and try to feed as much information to that. And we will have to keep a matrix, uh, and try to get a percentage that, uh, the bot at the first phase, uh, of, uh, development, the bot is, let's say, 25% accurate. And we need to maintain a steady pace, like, with every iteration as we are following the agile method. And, uh, you know, me being an agile practitioner for a for a really long time, like, 5 to 6 years, uh, we I try to implement things in, uh, you know, sprint oriented manner. So, uh, with every sprint, as we are to, uh, develop a backlog or we are trying to deliver a backlog, we need to keep the, you know, unit testing results in mind. And keeping that perspective into the context, we need to keep a track that the, uh, you know, uh, growth of the machine learning or the effectiveness of the AI bot is gradually increasing, uh, as the time, uh, gets passed, and, uh, there is no deep as such. So that, uh, at a at a later point of time, we can understand that during SIT, the bot is performing at its peak, and also during UPT, uh, it is it is performing, uh, as expected. But there will still be certain, uh, areas, uh, from where, uh, I mean, you know, uh, we we can get some, uh, you know, input where we can, uh, there will be scope of changes. So, yes, uh, getting that, uh, into the perspective, we must, uh, you know, uh, keep a scope for the improvement. But, uh, at the initial stage, it is it is very, very important to keep a track of the, uh, bot, uh, effectiveness or the bot accuracy.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Absolutely, tracking the bot's accuracy and effectiveness over time is essential for iterative improvement and aligning with business goals. Given your extensive experience with Agile methodologies, how do you incorporate feedback from these metrics into your sprint planning and backlog prioritization to ensure continuous improvement of the AI bot's performance? \\n\", 'Interviewee: See, it is very important to hold a retrospective session, um, you know, a retrospective meeting after each sprint So that, uh, in, uh, my personal, uh, opinion, what I do is I have a 30 minute session, uh, in which the first 15 minute is a silent session where all the members from the team, along with the product owner, gets a board. I, uh, prefer to use Azure DevOps, but I have a little bit of flavor of Jira as well. So there, I create a board where there are 3 sections, the things that went well, the things that could have been better, and and, uh, you know, the future, uh, future aspects. So all the members, uh, you know, they provide their input. And from the technical side, uh, the technical development team, it is important that they feed in the bot accuracy percentage, uh, as part of their retrospective session so that, uh, at every retrospective session which happens after, uh, every iteration that is after every sprint, we can track it. And at any point of time, if I feel that we are lagging behind at any point or the accuracy percentage is getting down so that, uh, we can directly create a task out of that, assign it to the right person, and get the team to work on that so that we never, uh, miss out on, uh, you know, uh, any any situation where, uh, there is a steady decline in terms of the, uh, you know, accuracy or in terms of the performance of the port.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's a solid strategy for incorporating continuous feedback into the development process. Leveraging tools like Azure DevOps and Jira for sprint retrospectives ensures that your team stays on top of the AI bot's performance and addresses any issues promptly. Considering your role in managing these complex projects, how do you balance the technical aspects with stakeholder communication to ensure that everyone is aligned with the project's progress and any technical challenges that arise? \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. This is something that I have faced throughout my, uh, career being a business analyst, scrum master, or project manager. And the stakeholder managements management comes as a as a very critical, uh, job, uh, being a functional person of the project. And, uh, you know, the the retrospective sessions that I talk about or the daily scrum meetings that I talk about, uh, we invite, uh, the collaborative approach from the client side as well so that the client, uh, representatives who are helping us to build the product can also come into picture, can, uh, you know, provide their valuable feedback, uh, uh, for our day to day activity. And alongside that, when they come into the retrospective meeting, they also get to know that what is happening, uh, around the project and, uh, things, uh, that are going right, things that are going wrong. Uh, also, uh, it is important to provide them a weekly status report. That is, uh, what that is a template that I follow, uh, where I try to, uh, come up with a structured approach of, uh, the the highlight points that has that is going on for this this particular project currently. Alongside that, what are my future plans? How the budget consumption, uh, looks like? Also, uh, I provide the burn down, the burn up chart, and the sprint velocity chart to that, uh, weekly status report so that it can reach to the relevant stakeholders. And at any point of time, if there are any unpleasant surprises, uh, in the, uh, project so that, uh, you know, alongside the team, the important stakeholders from the client side all are also aware of it, and they are on the same page so that we can take quick decisions to mitigate the issue and move forward.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to stakeholder management is very proactive and transparent, which is key to maintaining trust and ensuring project success. The inclusion of clients in the Agile process and the use of detailed reporting tools like burndown charts and velocity metrics provide a clear picture of project health to all parties involved. With your experience in both project management and technical domains, how do you ensure that the technical team's insights and concerns are effectively communicated to stakeholders who may not have a technical background? \\n\", \"Interviewee: It is very important to, uh, you know, communicate the problems our technical team is facing. But me, uh, being a business analyst or a project manager, it is my duty to understand the technical problems that they are facing. Because sometimes, uh, when the clients are asking for, uh, a certain, you know, uh, feature, uh, within the system, that might be out of the box. And it is so out of the box that right now, with the current architecture, with the current business flow, the process flow, it is very difficult to incorporate. Rather, it is impossible to incorporate. Because, uh, you know, when we are working in a dynamic industry like IT, there will be certain situations that you need to manage as a development team to go beyond your comfort zone to a little r and d and then prepare. But there are certain situations where the, uh, you know, thing that is being asked from the client side is, uh, way too, you know, difficult to implement in the current scenario. So, uh, it is important to important for me to understand the problem from the developer side. Uh, and after that, just try to, uh, you know, uh, make the client side understand the whole situation in a pretty layman term. Because, uh, the clients, uh, who are representing their own organization may or may not be technically sounded. So it is important for me to, uh, make that, uh, problem, uh, into a very layman terms, uh, and try to make them understand that this is what happened and that is the reason because of which we cannot, uh, implement that feature. And that has happened to me, uh, when, uh, I have built the customized CRM application at that point of time. Once a complaint was logged, uh, there was a request to, you know, uh, take the complaint back, uh, to the to the absolute beginning. But, uh, technically, that was not feasible because there are, you know, various, uh, aspects of a complaint when it is being, uh, logged. So, uh, you know, if if we can definitely, we can roll it back to the very initial stage. But the kind of data loss that is gonna gonna happen and the kind of, you know, uh, unused storage that is gonna remain there in the database, uh, that will not be a good approach in terms of, uh, you know, IT projects. So I make that understand to my clients. And at a later point of time, there are some counter arguments, but I was able to convince them that this is the reason we cannot do that. But, uh, you know, as a delighter, rather than doing that, I can suggest this. So this this is more of my approach that when, uh, we are going for a, uh, you know, no to a customer, it's not a straight no no. Rather than doing that, uh, you know, we can, you know, provide them some delighter so that will, you know, enhance their user experience overall.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

So in aerospace, first, I take it as a aerospace, then I'm moving to uh, power industry. So in aerospace, for, uh, PWC, pattern with the Canada, I have taken a project. It's a, uh, a manufacturing project. So I have to set up a new facility for manufacturing.

If it's goes something, uh, out of timeline, then getting a permission from, uh, actual, uh, management requesting, and they get the additional timeline. And, uh, and with the justification, I get the timeline, then we can proceed further. And deliberately working towards the deadline to the project on, yeah, on any of the, uh, NPI and NPD products. So this is from Aerospace. And coming back to, uh, power, power NPI is nothing but, um, the steam turbine, newly, uh, new factory project it is. It starts from, uh, greenfield projects, and it's, uh, it this is also it's, uh, again, starts from creating a specification for the requirement to the, uh, digital fact. Again, this, uh, digital factory requirement and, uh, it's involved IO IIoT, networking, and IT infrastructure for digital manufacturing and especially integrating all the, uh, NPA manufacturing machines, uh, materials, even, uh, deploy, uh, engineering teams and integrating with the r and d engineering and the manufacturing and cross functionals like finance, uh, HR, supply chain, admin. Because this is a project is a whole lot of things involved since it's a newly built uh, factory project. So I have taken initially, I have taken as a IT, uh, role since, uh, my role as a CAT CAM project manager role, it's come in between. So during that period, I take an IT infrastructure and creating the entire IT infra for the, uh, IT, uh, sorry, factory project. And during that time, I have taken as, uh, my second responsibility that, uh, integration CAT cam integration as a part. And that I'll consider in during IT. And according to that, the steps were followed and the, um, the facility is created. So this is 1. And, uh, and, uh, during that time, I supposed to, um, handle the 2 type of budget because one is IT infrastructure budget, and second one is, uh, I'd uh, I IT and IS project budget. So both the way, it will be a a timeline based because this project is delayed by one of the fear, uh, from the earlier place to new place. So, uh, the timeline has freeze like anything. So according to that, we have, uh, focusedly worked to deliver the NPA product to the customer that is, uh, government of India. And they have given minimum of 18 months to build and, uh, give the, uh, first part out, first NPA to get approval from customer that we have done greatly with, uh, all the, uh, cross functional supports with, uh, our experts. Uh, this is, uh, enormous output and the timely deliver we have given. So based out of it, uh, by 2,016, my entire project team, including the, uh, technical support team under me, have taken a a g award for, uh, deliver, uh, as prior as expected, uh, such a title it is. It was, uh, really appreciated that that we have achieved that project within the timeline. Hope these two project as a NPA and the NPD are done. And name my last role, uh, the another project that's called product development. That is, again, purely the NPA product. That product, they call the drill bit. In the drill bit, that is, uh, this is a oil and gas, uh, project. In that drill bit, it was earlier semi automated, uh, functionally, the operations and the functions are captured. But, uh, the prior NPA is given for me and my team is it need to be automated. The entire, uh, drill bit operation function need to be captured. So there's a lot of, uh, brainstorm has taken and, uh, a lot of study have taken from various oil and gas field, uh, datas. With that, we have modified the sensors and the gyro sensors and turn on bit, wait on bit. Those things were consider, and it will be implemented into the circuit form and designed. And those things, again, uh, it's a new first time we have implemented and first time we have developed the product in India, um, uh, with the, uh, localization under the heading of an organization. So earlier, this project and the product is developed in US. Combantly, US and India, almost 65%. We have reduced the, uh, new development cost with this localization heading. And this is another achievement, based out of this 2020 sorry. 2019, me and my team has got the award that, uh, we, uh, across the boundary, we across the boundary, we are sure the deli verse. So such a title, we got it another g award. So such a way, uh, all the 3 in fact, the 3 companies I have worked and all the 3 companies, I have one another way. I have achieved, uh, the, uh, project expectation, and I make it a profit to the uh, business as expected. Based out of it, the awards shows how I performed and how I got that awards. Hope this is enough on the project of NPA and NPD in the new setups. Do you have any other, uh, points to discuss? Uh, shall we go on to the next\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for that comprehensive overview of your experience with NPI/NPD projects across different industries. It's clear that you have a strong track record of delivering complex projects on time and under budget. Given your background in digital manufacturing and IT, could you discuss how you've integrated digital transformation initiatives within these projects, and perhaps share an example of how you leveraged technology to improve efficiency or outcomes? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, here I have to take it that, uh, project delivery sorry. Uh, project delivery of factory. So this factory, uh, the, uh, notation is given for me is, uh, uh, digital manufacturing. So digital manufacturing is a notation for me as a, uh, project manager. So as I told in the NPA in the last question, the from the starting, the entire factory is build considering and keeping in the mind that the digital manufacturing and the each and every equipment, it will be coming and bringing to IoT networks. So based out of it, the entire equipments, uh, equipments in the sense, I can say about, uh, production machine, product, uh, even start from cutting machine, then production machine, then measuring machines, CMM, even for the Vernier Calipers and other equipment, uh, screw, uh, uh, screw micrometers and whatever is a small measuring equipments. Everything it's bringing to the digitalization mode. So even though if we did the manual equipment, we'll in we'll introduce a sensor on it. And based out of the sensors and, uh, based of the sensor, the data, whatever we are measuring on the equipment, even in the machine, even in the, uh, production mesh, and every datas, it'll be collected via, um, Wi Fi, sometime Wi Fi, sometime USB, uh, through USB cable, the machines and the instruments connected to the network, IoT network. Through the IoT network, the data will be going to store in the database. In the database from the database, the data, it'll be bringing bridge to SAP, where, uh, we have developed, uh, our routers and, uh, process cards and process monitoring and quality check, all those things. So all the datas, whatever functionally captured, those things will be stored in database. From the database, it's pushed to the, uh, SAP related to the operation, related to the function, related to the setups. So this is one setup, front end setup in intermediate setup. And back end setup, again, uh, we have, uh, in, uh, GE, we have used that, um, predicts platform. This is a dedicated platform like AWS, Amazon, um, AWS. This predicts platform. Again, it's give the leverage to take the datas. Whatever the datas we stored in the SAP, those, uh, datas can be pulled to the, um, predicts platform, and the predicts platform will generate, uh, applications, uh, which shows the performance of each and every equipment, every, uh, machine's performance. Those datas will be collected, and it will be designed into the software, uh, display. Display. Those displays, it will be again, uh, it will be showcased in front of each machines and each equipments. On collective report, it will be showcased into a, uh, plan manager and production manager as well as MD. And where who are it need to be monitored the performance of man, material, and machineries is everything it's collected and integrated. And those integration, it'll be displayed as a, uh, UAA screen into the, uh, required, uh, managers and decision, uh, take it can view this with their logins. So with that performance, if it goes down now as per the schedule, then immediate pop up, it'll be raised via first, it will rise via email to supervisor, then it will be send it to manager, and next, it will go into plan manager. If nothing has happened, then it'll move on to the MD. So such a way, the entire factory, it will be integrated in terms of technical system and the physical equipments. And those the equipments, datas will be collected in and stored into, uh, database and database from the database, uh, the push will happen to SAP from the SAP. Again, as a, um, uh, predicts platform, we collect all the datas and develop the UIA and display to entire, uh, management of the performance. So this is this way, uh, with the, uh, digitalization is happened, uh, on each and every equipments. So, um, uh, this is all the conventional machine. I mean to say, even if it is CNC machines, it will perform its, uh, indigenous. But, uh, once coming to the factory and bringing to the IIoT network platform, then it will be integrated and make it as a digitalization to collect the required information. Such a way the entire equipment is done and made it into the production, uh, up and running. So once this is done and, uh, over the 2016, by the time the project is done, the digital manufacturing, by the time I was asked to do it, the entire factory as a smart factory. So the in the factory, there is a activity. The main activity is called, uh, manufacturing. So the initial step is manufacturing related activity, cross functionals, and all these interlinking functions have made it at a digital manufacturing platform. Then now it's asked for the, uh, smart factory. The smart factory is nothing but the entire factory activity apart from, uh, manufacturing. Uh, there is a a supply chain. There is a finance. There will be a admin. There will be a, um, HR. So such a way, all the cross functionals teams has to bring into the digitalization. So how it is, again, this performance, all it will be stored into the SAP, And this SAP data's again, each and every cross functionals will make it a segregation, these datas, and send it to according to their functions, what are the data is required, and we'll send to them. So this is one part of segregation data segregation be done, and they give it to, uh, rec record functions. And there, we'll make it a small UOE according to their functions and their performance and their output, how it will perform. Such a way, we will create the cross functional, uh, UAEs and, um, such a way, the cross functions are coming under the digital manufacturing and smart factory. Again, apart from this cross functional, there is a physical and inventory management and security management and the attendance management. Those things are coming under the Smart Factory. The Smart Factory is nothing but again, whenever any good person or, uh, message is coming via gate, From that point, it start that digitalization. Uh, then it will convert, and it will be converted as a value added services to the material man or whatever else. Once it's going out of another exit gate, by the time the all the records have starts from gate in entry gate to exit gate, everything, it will be monitored and controlled and, uh, make it, uh, data driven, uh, data driven point of each activity. And such a way, I made it entire factory into a smart factory. So that mean so nothing can't escape as a manual operation or manual function. So entire things, it will be tracked and captured in, uh, in the digital form, and the entire factory is converted now in 2018. It's everything is converted into the smart factory. So by the time I have completed this digitalization and smart factory activities, So this was good. Do you have any, uh, points related to, uh, digitalization and smart factory? If it's so, we can proceed. Otherwise, we'll jump into the next question. Thanks for taking the time to\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Start the interview? Yes.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at Excelmax Technologies. As a Software Manager, what were your primary responsibilities, and how did you ensure your team met its project deadlines effectively? Moving on, at R Systems as a Senior Project Lead, you mentioned developing software for ZTR Modem and multithreaded applications for the RAIL division. Could you elaborate on the challenges you faced while developing multithreaded applications and how you overcame them? As the Technical Manager at GreyOrange, improving product performance by 20% is quite an achievement. Can you discuss the strategies or technologies you implemented to achieve this improvement? In your role as Chief Technology Officer at Zeleno, developing IoT-based reverse vending machines sounds innovative. What were the key technical hurdles in developing these machines, and how did you address them? Lastly, during your tenure at TradebooX, you developed multithreaded programs and mail/messaging platforms. Could you share more about the scale of these projects and any specific technologies you used to ensure scalability and reliability? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Forms. Could you share more about the scale of these projects and any specific technologies you use to ensure scalability and reliability? Okay. So starting with, uh, my current role at Xlmex Technologies. I am, uh, I worked as software manager in Xlmix Technologies. And in Xlmix Technologies, my basic goal and responsibility was to, uh, handle the key project at Google. And, uh, in the key project, basically, I was basically leading the test automation software test automation framework. So, basically, we need to develop a single test automation framework, which can be, uh, used to, uh, test various, uh, chips, silicon chips, basically, uh, in, uh, Google. So that's that's how, uh, it came. And, uh, I mentored a team of 5 people over here, And, uh, the the piece, uh, point was to the develop the test automation framework, which was developed in due course of time. And, uh, therefore, we we delivered the same, uh, in Google. The second thing, uh, about my own NASA system, uh, so, basically, there, I developed a complex, uh, a lot of them for a ZTR modem. Uh, ZTR modem basically works on CAN automation. So you work CAN auto CAN protocol, basically. And this CAN protocol, basically, I wrote, uh, an application in Python and c to as a, you know, back end language. So that the GUI was also developed in Python language, and thereby, I implemented the CAN, uh, bus communication. So thereby, achieving the automation of the ZTR modem, uh, on the OpenAI platform, which, uh, ZTR, uh, Canada, basically, the company was having. Now, uh, coming back to, uh, GreyOrange, uh, Limited. So in GreyOrange, uh, India Limited, I, uh, I I worked as a technical manager. And in this technical manager, I had, I had used I have established here and, uh, consistent communication channel between various teams so that they can easily collaborate. Okay. There were regular meetings. Uh, then, uh, I opened the communication channel to ensure all teams are well informed and aligned. I also used CanCan software to the track the progress of the project. Uh, with regard to cross functional team, so I, um, basically, uh, formed the team, uh, members from both software and hardware, and, uh, jointly, uh, bring them into common platform using the back end software and managing teaming, uh, RNT meetings. Then the joint ownership was also there. Uh, in this, basically, I promoted the culture of shared ownership, uh, over the entire project and not the individual components. So this includes the accountability and intelligent collaboration. So now some of the technical functions which are implemented was, like, modular architecture, standardized API, which we generally use in into practice. And then after that, the process and planning. So process and planning, basically, like, change management, uh, process, the performance monitoring, clear requirements, definitions. So those things were laid down. Additionally, I also, uh, went ahead with tools and technology. So basically, we use ROS automation, ROS operating system, basically, for managing the robots. And, uh, on the data station, basically, we use different kind of sensors and integrated them using, uh, a little Python, basically. The Python was a basic programming language along with c, uh, as a brand background language. Now there was additional factors like some kind of team training was also important to pick up certain members, uh, on board. Okay? And, uh, quickly ramp up, uh, that so that they can turn into more productive, uh, thing. Okay. Now, uh, apart from that, now the next was like Treebox. In Treebox, basically, I used a Python language, uh, as a, uh, basic programming language to, uh, ensure the multisargate, uh, and created a multisargate environment where basically I, uh, was able to achieve, uh, the communication between various applications. So the I, uh, introduced a mail and messaging platform to share the data between various processes uh, using Python, uh, as a, uh, language. Okay. And there are developing complex framework so that, uh, each message is well accounted. And if if they are not, uh, scheduled, uh, so scheduling scheduler and all those things also, I load for, uh, that particular project. So that's it.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those insights. It's clear you've had a significant impact across various projects and technologies. Let's pivot to some technical questions based on the skills listed in your resume summary. Given your experience with Python, can you discuss a complex problem you solved using Python's concurrency features, such as threading or asyncio, and how you ensured thread safety or managed asynchronous tasks? Moving on to C++, you've likely encountered situations where performance optimization was critical. Could you describe a scenario where you had to optimize a piece of C++ code for performance, including the tools or techniques you used to identify bottlenecks and measure improvements? Regarding shell scripting, it's a powerful tool for automation and system management. Can you explain a situation where you used shell scripting to automate a complex system task, detailing the script's functionality and how you ensured its reliability and efficiency? With your experience in communication protocols, particularly MQTT and CAN, how did you implement these in a project, and what were the challenges in ensuring reliable data transmission and handling in a real-time system? Lastly, in the realm of AI and ML, could you discuss a project where you applied machine learning algorithms to solve a real-world problem, including the choice of algorithm, how you trained and tested your model, and the outcome of the project? \\n\", \"Interviewee: With your experience in communication protocols, particularly MQTT and CAN, how did you implement these in a project, and what were the challenges in ensuring reliable data transmission and handling in a real time system? Lastly, in the realm of AI and ML, could you discuss a project where you applied machine learning algorithms to solve a real world problem, including the choice of algorithm, how you trained and tested your model, and the outcome of the project? Okay. So, uh, with respect to, uh, the asynchronous program, so why you'll be using basically, we use asynchronous programming is useful in situation where we are dealing with AI mode task. Okay? And we want to keep our program more responsive and handle multiple concurrency efficiently. Now in this, basically, I, uh, what what I use is, like, I, uh, developed some coroutines, task, even flutes. Okay? So in this event flutes, uh, are, uh, like, for managing the coroutines with asynchronous application, and they should use their execution and switching them between them as as well needed. So, basically, we use the keywords like async and await to, uh, pause the coroutine until the weighted operation. Now choosing the right asynchronous library is also important over here. So I use a c asyncio library for various, uh, test use cases. Okay? So that's how, uh, that was there, uh, with this. Now, uh, the with NQTT implementation. So MQTT, basically, I, uh, chose the MQTT broker, uh, as, like, Paho, uh, LQTT broker. And I had waited as in prior experience in LQTT library also. That's why, uh, I chose that. Then, basically, over there, I use JSON structure to, uh, send the, uh, packet and receive the packet. And, uh, they are basically to ensure that the packet is, uh, the packet is successfully delivered. I, uh, develop acknowledgment, uh, packet also. Like, in response to a message, there will be an acknowledge message message, which will be there. And then the the next thing is, like, the maintaining the QoS level. So that in QS level, there are various type of level like 0, 1, 2, whichever you can mention. So if it is it is, uh, 0, then it the, uh, chances of, uh, sending the message are higher. So that's how it is, uh, it was used. Yes. Uh, and in case of\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Fascinating use of asyncio in Python to manage concurrency and the strategic implementation of MQTT for reliable communication. Your approach to using coroutines and event loops for asynchronous tasks showcases a deep understanding of Python's capabilities to handle I/O-bound and high-latency tasks efficiently. Regarding the MQTT implementation, your choice of the Mosquitto broker and the use of JSON for structuring messages demonstrate a practical approach to IoT communications. The acknowledgment mechanism and QoS levels you mentioned are crucial for ensuring message delivery reliability in distributed systems. Let's delve deeper into some other technical areas:\\n\\n1. In your work with C++, how did you approach memory management in a project where minimizing memory usage was critical? Could you describe the techniques or strategies you employed to reduce memory footprint and prevent memory leaks? 2. Shell scripting offers a wide range of possibilities for system automation. Could you share an example where you used shell scripting to integrate multiple systems or services, highlighting how you managed error handling and script maintainability? 3. With your experience in embedded systems, how have you utilized C in developing firmware for microcontrollers? Specifically, can you discuss a project where you had to optimize code for resource-constrained devices, including how you managed code size and execution speed? 4. Given your background in AI and ML, could you elaborate on a project where you had to deal with imbalanced datasets? How did you approach the problem, and what techniques did you use to ensure your model performed well on minority classes? These questions aim to explore the depth of your technical expertise in the areas you've highlighted in your resume. \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So, basically, uh, coming here to the first question, which was memory management in c plus plus. So, basically, in memory management management in c plus plus, we have different region like stack, deep end. So the allocation and the allocation, we basically use music new and delete. And, uh, basically, uh, we also use the smart pointer. Now the common issues come here is, like, memory leaks and these things. So, like, memory leaks is, like, uh, if suppose you forget to delete dynamically allocated memory, which can cause to unsure memory location or the dangling point of concern where you access the memory that has been already been deallocated. All the or or double string the memory. So I best practice, uh, is, like, when I make use of smart partners wherever possible, especially dynamically allocated objects. Okay? Second thing is, like, I ensure proper automatic resource management here. Uh, then third thing, I, uh, tested the code thoroughly with memory. You'll take test like, uh, tools such as wild guide. So wild guide is basically using, uh, identifying the potential memory leaks in a code. So I ran the WellGuide, uh, software WellGuide tool on my software and, uh, found out, like, where the there are chances of potential memory leak and thereby correcting them as as in that over there. Then the next question is, like, how do you see in developing microcontrollers? So, basically, in this, basically, we will choose, like, which kind of microcontroller we want to use. Okay? So properly, uh, properly, we can use an SBC also. We can use a microcontroller also. So SBC is like that verify ESP32. Uh, you know, they comes into SBC. And if you choose specific microcontroller, like, big microcontroller and this thing. So, uh, so now, basically, we need to, uh, understand what are the hardware interaction, which are the, like, I2C, SDI, you are which are the basically communication protocols we will be using with. And what we have to, uh, like, we have to put the appropriate code into place. So first and foremost, that is, like, the driving the development, uh, like, writing the the driver for development. So, basically, once the driver is tested, modular programming. So I developed the firmware where, uh, basically, we have to optimally use, and the same routine can be used as multiple. Like, suppose, for example, if you have to operate GPIO from various, uh, code part of codes, okay, for various operation. So you will have a single GPS class. In that class, basically, you call, uh, you identify a GPIO, set it as input or output, and operate, uh, that particular GPU, likewise. So that's how I reduce the code size, uh, in this. Now coming back to artificial intelligence at this thing. So, basically, I use machine learning project in, uh, basically recognizing a device similar to Alexa. So here, basically, the idea was to, uh, integrate, uh, intelligence into the device, uh, so that, uh, what variable, uh, you know, when many of us, we are interacting with it. So we are able to, uh, it can identify, like, what is, uh, required. Please, for example, like, uh, one was the mood swings, the person identified the mood swings. So mood swings were captured through a camera. And, uh, through a camera, we were able to identify, like, to the facial expression, uh, using computer vision algorithm. So we're in facial expression like the weather, what kind of mood in a person is in. And according to that, play some kind of melodies so that the person will be, uh, overcome, uh, that. That's\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your detailed explanations provide a clear view of your technical prowess and problem-solving skills. The use of smart pointers in C++ for memory management is indeed a best practice to avoid common pitfalls like memory leaks and dangling pointers. Your approach to using tools like Valgrind to identify and rectify potential memory leaks further underscores your commitment to robust and efficient code. In the realm of microcontroller development, your emphasis on modular programming and driver development for hardware interaction showcases a methodical approach to embedded systems. This strategy not only ensures code reusability and efficiency but also simplifies the complexity involved in managing hardware resources, which is crucial for optimizing performance and resource utilization in embedded devices. Your AI project involving mood detection through facial expressions is particularly intriguing. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning to interpret human emotions and respond with appropriate music selections demonstrates innovative thinking and the practical application of AI and ML technologies. This project highlights your ability to integrate AI with IoT devices to create intelligent systems that enhance user experiences. Let's delve a bit deeper into some technical specifics:\\n\\n1. Regarding your use of smart pointers in C++, could you discuss a specific instance where transitioning from raw pointers to smart pointers significantly improved the safety or efficiency of a project? How did you decide which type of smart pointer was most appropriate for the situation? 2. In your embedded systems work, you mentioned the importance of choosing the right microcontroller and communication protocols. Could you elaborate on a project where the choice of microcontroller and its communication capabilities were critical to the project's success? How did you evaluate and decide on the best microcontroller for the task? 3. For the AI project on mood detection, selecting the right algorithm and training data is crucial. Could you discuss the process you went through to select the machine learning algorithm for facial expression recognition? How did you ensure the model was trained with a diverse dataset to accurately recognize a wide range of emotions? These questions aim to dive deeper into your technical decision-making process and how you apply your skills to solve complex problems. \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay, so converting the raw pointers first question converted to Smart pointer. So suppose to basically we have a raw pointer where we allocate some kind of memory using Neo and now can say for example, we use a unique pointer with that. Okay. So now here the explanation will go like this. Like when we use the unique pointers, so unique points on which take the ownership of a raw pointer asked to Constructor. So in smartphone will automatically delete on the internal drop point or when it goes out of scope. So that that's how it ensures proper memory DL location. Okay. Now that efficiency of smart pointers. So now efficiency of smart point is like it comes into memory safety reduce that you will see because here you don't have to worry about like whether it goes out of scope. So what will happen whether it will be allocated or not actually, you know causing a memory leak. So here that is being taken care of now. The next thing is like the boot detection process, you ask. So the we want to text in process using facial expansion, which you see well it is first of all like the face Mark we have to detect a piece. So first up involves a process where we have faced in we have to isolate a phase from the particularly. So in that case we can use basically the hard Cascade and in that arcade from there we can find out which is the case part and which is the best of the body part. Then there is the landmark detection. So once the face is detected so specific. Point on the face is called landmarks. Okay, and they correspond to the face shield features. Like I Rose eyes mouth nose. Okay. Now next thing comes is let the feature actually extract those features. Okay, these ones the face mask measured in life. So we will expect those features and then next up is the classification so classification is just like what is a we will have we are we had a large data set of labeled facial expression and corresponding to that food. We were able to identify. What is the predicted we were supposed to predict of the particular person. So basically it was happy sad and angry whatever the mood is and then in this mood expression, so it is all always it may not be always very accurate, but we delivered it with good accuracy, which was 192.54. it so that's it.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. I can. Great.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! With your extensive experience in the Aerospace, Power, and Oil & Gas industries, could you share an example of a new business setup for NPI/NPD industrialization that you led, and how you approached the challenges that came with it? \\n', 'Interviewee: In aerospace It seems there might have been a miss\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It seems there might have been a misunderstanding. I'm looking for a detailed response to the question about your experience with new business setups for NPI/NPD industrialization. Could you please elaborate on a specific project, the challenges you faced, and the strategies you used to overcome them? \\n\", \"Interviewee: So NPI and NPD projects related, uh, news startups related projects, I'll going to explain here. So in aerospace, first, I take it as a aerospace, then I'm moving to uh, power industry. So in aerospace, for, uh, PWC, pattern with the Canada, I have taken a project. It's a, uh, a manufacturing project. So I have to set up a new facility for manufacturing. It includes, uh, getting a budget approval, then, uh, setting a new facility and, uh, implementing a new machine on for that, then, uh, train the people towards that NPA and NPT, then, uh, bring into package and make it uh, prove the component into the, uh, n NPI. And once it's done, then it's handover to the production team. So such a way, the aerospace industry in PMI engineering export, uh, Private Limited. This project is carried out for PWC Canada. So this has given a lot of experience for me to hiring, uh, new team, hiring a new machines for the specific, uh, project, and train them and coach them and deploy the line of, uh, NPA production. So each and every corner, I have to manage the budget according to the stepwise and the stage wise, uh, to monitor the timeline. If it's goes something, uh, out of timeline, then getting a permission from, uh, actual, uh, management requesting, and they get the additional timeline. And, uh, and with the justification, I get the timeline, then we can proceed further. And deliberately working towards the deadline to the project on, yeah, on any of the, uh, NPI and NPD products. So this is from Aerospace. And coming back to, uh, power, power NPI is nothing but, um, the steam turbine, newly, uh, new factory project it is. It starts from, uh, greenfield projects, and it's, uh, it this is also it's, uh, again, starts from creating a specification for the requirement to the, uh, digital fact. Again, this, uh, digital factory requirement and, uh, it's involved IO IIoT, networking, and IT infrastructure for digital manufacturing and especially integrating all the, uh, NPA manufacturing machines, uh, materials, even, uh, deploy, uh, engineering teams and integrating with the r and d engineering and the manufacturing and cross functionals like finance, uh, HR, supply chain, admin. Because this is a project is a whole lot of things involved since it's a newly built uh, factory project. So I have taken initially, I have taken as a IT, uh, role since, uh, my role as a CAT CAM project manager role, it's come in between. So during that period, I take an IT infrastructure and creating the entire IT infra for the, uh, IT, uh, sorry, factory project. And during that time, I have taken as, uh, my second responsibility that, uh, integration CAT cam integration as a part. And that I'll consider in during IT. And according to that, the steps were followed and the, um, the facility is created. So this is 1. And, uh, and, uh, during that time, I supposed to, um, handle the 2 type of budget because one is IT infrastructure budget, and second one is, uh, I'd uh, I IT and IS project budget. So both the way, it will be a a timeline based because this project is delayed by one of the fear, uh, from the earlier place to new place. So, uh, the timeline has freeze like anything. So according to that, we have, uh, focusedly worked to deliver the NPA product to the customer that is, uh, government of India. And they have given minimum of 18 months to build and, uh, give the, uh, first part out, first NPA to get approval from customer that we have done greatly with, uh, all the, uh, cross functional supports with, uh, our experts. Uh, this is, uh, enormous output and the timely deliver we have given. So based out of it, uh, by 2,016, my entire project team, including the, uh, technical support team under me, have taken a a g award for, uh, deliver, uh, as prior as expected, uh, such a title it is. It was, uh, really appreciated that that we have achieved that project within the timeline. Hope these two project as a NPA and the NPD are done. And name my last role, uh, the another project that's called product development. That is, again, purely the NPA product. That product, they call the drill bit. In the drill bit, that is, uh, this is a oil and gas, uh, project. In that drill bit, it was earlier semi automated, uh, functionally, the operations and the functions are captured. But, uh, the prior NPA is given for me and my team is it need to be automated. The entire, uh, drill bit operation function need to be captured. So there's a lot of, uh, brainstorm has taken and, uh, a lot of study have taken from various oil and gas field, uh, datas. With that, we have modified the sensors and the gyro sensors and turn on bit, wait on bit. Those things were consider, and it will be implemented into the circuit form and designed. And those things, again, uh, it's a new first time we have implemented and first time we have developed the product in India, um, uh, with the, uh, localization under the heading of an organization. So earlier, this project and the product is developed in US. Combantly, US and India, almost 65%. We have reduced the, uh, new development cost with this localization heading. And this is another achievement, based out of this 2020 sorry. 2019, me and my team has got the award that, uh, we, uh, across the boundary, we across the boundary, we are sure the deli verse. So such a title, we got it another g award. So such a way, uh, all the 3 in fact, the 3 companies I have worked and all the 3 companies, I have one another way. I have achieved, uh, the, uh, project expectation, and I make it a profit to the uh, business as expected. Based out of it, the awards shows how I performed and how I got that awards. Hope this is enough on the project of NPA and NPD in the new setups. Do you have any other, uh, points to discuss? Uh, shall we go on to the next\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for that comprehensive overview of your experience with NPI/NPD projects across different industries. It's clear that you have a strong track record of delivering complex projects on time and under budget. Given your background in digital manufacturing and IT, could you discuss how you've integrated digital transformation initiatives within these projects, and perhaps share an example of how you leveraged technology to improve efficiency or outcomes? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, here I have to take it that, uh, project delivery sorry. Uh, project delivery of factory. So this factory, uh, the, uh, notation is given for me is, uh, uh, digital manufacturing. So digital manufacturing is a notation for me as a, uh, project manager. So as I told in the NPA in the last question, the from the starting, the entire factory is build considering and keeping in the mind that the digital manufacturing and the each and every equipment, it will be coming and bringing to IoT networks. So based out of it, the entire equipments, uh, equipments in the sense, I can say about, uh, production machine, product, uh, even start from cutting machine, then production machine, then measuring machines, CMM, even for the Vernier Calipers and other equipment, uh, screw, uh, uh, screw micrometers and whatever is a small measuring equipments. Everything it's bringing to the digitalization mode. So even though if we did the manual equipment, we'll in we'll introduce a sensor on it. And based out of the sensors and, uh, based of the sensor, the data, whatever we are measuring on the equipment, even in the machine, even in the, uh, production mesh, and every datas, it'll be collected via, um, Wi Fi, sometime Wi Fi, sometime USB, uh, through USB cable, the machines and the instruments connected to the network, IoT network. Through the IoT network, the data will be going to store in the database. In the database from the database, the data, it'll be bringing bridge to SAP, where, uh, we have developed, uh, our routers and, uh, process cards and process monitoring and quality check, all those things. So all the datas, whatever functionally captured, those things will be stored in database. From the database, it's pushed to the, uh, SAP related to the operation, related to the function, related to the setups. So this is one setup, front end setup in intermediate setup. And back end setup, again, uh, we have, uh, in, uh, GE, we have used that, um, predicts platform. This is a dedicated platform like AWS, Amazon, um, AWS. This predicts platform. Again, it's give the leverage to take the datas. Whatever the datas we stored in the SAP, those, uh, datas can be pulled to the, um, predicts platform, and the predicts platform will generate, uh, applications, uh, which shows the performance of each and every equipment, every, uh, machine's performance. Those datas will be collected, and it will be designed into the software, uh, display. Display. Those displays, it will be again, uh, it will be showcased in front of each machines and each equipments. On collective report, it will be showcased into a, uh, plan manager and production manager as well as MD. And where who are it need to be monitored the performance of man, material, and machineries is everything it's collected and integrated. And those integration, it'll be displayed as a, uh, UAA screen into the, uh, required, uh, managers and decision, uh, take it can view this with their logins. So with that performance, if it goes down now as per the schedule, then immediate pop up, it'll be raised via first, it will rise via email to supervisor, then it will be send it to manager, and next, it will go into plan manager. If nothing has happened, then it'll move on to the MD. So such a way, the entire factory, it will be integrated in terms of technical system and the physical equipments. And those the equipments, datas will be collected in and stored into, uh, database and database from the database, uh, the push will happen to SAP from the SAP. Again, as a, um, uh, predicts platform, we collect all the datas and develop the UIA and display to entire, uh, management of the performance. So this is this way, uh, with the, uh, digitalization is happened, uh, on each and every equipments. So, um, uh, this is all the conventional machine. I mean to say, even if it is CNC machines, it will perform its, uh, indigenous. But, uh, once coming to the factory and bringing to the IIoT network platform, then it will be integrated and make it as a digitalization to collect the required information. Such a way the entire equipment is done and made it into the production, uh, up and running. So once this is done and, uh, over the 2016, by the time the project is done, the digital manufacturing, by the time I was asked to do it, the entire factory as a smart factory. So the in the factory, there is a activity. The main activity is called, uh, manufacturing. So the initial step is manufacturing related activity, cross functionals, and all these interlinking functions have made it at a digital manufacturing platform. Then now it's asked for the, uh, smart factory. The smart factory is nothing but the entire factory activity apart from, uh, manufacturing. Uh, there is a a supply chain. There is a finance. There will be a admin. There will be a, um, HR. So such a way, all the cross functionals teams has to bring into the digitalization. So how it is, again, this performance, all it will be stored into the SAP, And this SAP data's again, each and every cross functionals will make it a segregation, these datas, and send it to according to their functions, what are the data is required, and we'll send to them. So this is one part of segregation data segregation be done, and they give it to, uh, rec record functions. And there, we'll make it a small UOE according to their functions and their performance and their output, how it will perform. Such a way, we will create the cross functional, uh, UAEs and, um, such a way, the cross functions are coming under the digital manufacturing and smart factory. Again, apart from this cross functional, there is a physical and inventory management and security management and the attendance management. Those things are coming under the Smart Factory. The Smart Factory is nothing but again, whenever any good person or, uh, message is coming via gate, From that point, it start that digitalization. Uh, then it will convert, and it will be converted as a value added services to the material man or whatever else. Once it's going out of another exit gate, by the time the all the records have starts from gate in entry gate to exit gate, everything, it will be monitored and controlled and, uh, make it, uh, data driven, uh, data driven point of each activity. And such a way, I made it entire factory into a smart factory. So that mean so nothing can't escape as a manual operation or manual function. So entire things, it will be tracked and captured in, uh, in the digital form, and the entire factory is converted now in 2018. It's everything is converted into the smart factory. So by the time I have completed this digitalization and smart factory activities, So this was good. Do you have any, uh, points related to, uh, digitalization and smart factory?

Hello? Can you hear me?\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've built the analytics function from the ground up at two startups, Vedantu and Newton School. Could you walk me through the key steps you took to establish these functions and how you leveraged AWS in this process? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Could you walk me through the key steps you took to establish these functions and how you leveraged AWS in this process? Sure. So, uh, I when I joined Vedantu, Vedantu is a very small organization. It was a series b startup of around, uh, $200,000,000 valuation. Uh, the first thing that I wanted to do as soon as I came in was, uh, establish the data infrastructure in Virantu. Right? So what that meant is we have a, uh, infrastructure where, uh, you have multiple data sources coming in, uh, and and multiple data coming in from all these different sources. Right? And proper problems in, uh, early level start ups is key. You have lots of data, but you don't know exactly which data is correct. And leadership specifically is not our key on how to, uh, make decisions out of this, uh, improper data. Right? Because there are key issues with data inconsistency only mainly. And second thing is key, uh, everyone everyone kind of uses this particular data. Right? So so it becomes very difficult to make decisions, quality decisions, out of this, uh, this data. So what I did initially was, uh, we built a, uh, 3 it's a 3 part system. The first part is focused around the data engineering part, where we kind of, uh, segregated all the different data sources that we have. In terms of data sources, let's say you can have data internally being from of Mongo. You can have, uh, data in in some CRM like a Salesforce or a LeadSquared, or you can have product analytics, uh, softwares or tools, API connections where you store data. Right? Now what we did was, uh, we kind of filtered all this data using Airbyte and Airflow. We transferred them into Redshift, which is AWS. Right? Uh, Data warehouse. Uh, we use Redshift because it stores data very efficiently in the form of columnar database. It's because it's a columnar database. And, uh, this was the first step. The second stage was, uh, the data analytics well apart. Where we what we did was we segregated this data that we have collated from all the different sources that you have into a specific, uh, DB, which we call the data layer. And this layer essentially had all fact and dimension tables on Fact and dimension tables, meaning, I'll say, you have a user fact, which is a fact table at the user level, but that users are describing that, and the transaction tables, which is a transaction table. So a very standard definition of metrics and definitions. Metrics and dimensions is what we created. This was the 2nd layer. And the 3rd layer which we built on top of it is the aggregation layer, what we called the, uh, reporting layer. We aggregated all these numbers or all these features that we had or metrics that we had and, uh, reported proper aggregations in this particular, uh, layer. We re we stored everything in that particular layer. And this part these were the 3 steps. And this particular final stage, the reporting layer, the ARL is what we call analytics reporting layer, was connected to BI tool. In our case, the BI tool was the business intelligence, uh, very popular business intelligence tool called Tableau. We, uh, onboarded and and and maybe started it from scratch, uh, build dashboards on top of it. So the entire problem which we had at the beginning, right, data quality issue, the inconsistency, and, uh, specifically, data not being available quickly. Right? Those problems are solved because everyone started from the CEO to the very end. Right? To end stakeholders as in, like, some executives. Right? They had access to this quality data at their fingertips because everything was smooth line, uh, and, uh, everything was stored in a very efficient way. And if you just wanted to query anything, you can just you don't even have to query. You can go to the dashboards and and get that particular number. And the good part was key, it was very efficient in terms of, uh, pulling out numbers very quickly. So it improved decision making by making data available faster. And the second thing was the data consistency was there, so there was no discrepancy in taking any decisions. Right? Because everyone was there what data was saying. Specifically, if there was a problem in terms of, say, number drop, RCA could be done very easily. Even if there were some high highs, then you can exactly know what's contributing to the high highs. Right? So so this entire process took a big, uh, significant amount of time, some 6 months' time, And we finally made this particular, uh, entire part where we could, uh, streamline the data part in the analytics journey. Right? The second part was, of course, building a team, um, in in in the system because analytics journeys always have two important things. 1 is the data part. The second one is teams. And the third one is a mix of both where you align the proper team to the all resources, human resources to the to the to the projects or or to the data. Right? So the first part is what I had explained right now, getting in the data, sorting the pipelines, and the business intelligence framework is what we built in the first part, which I had just said. 2nd part was getting the team. We tried to follow an Airbnb model here where you have 3 distinct things. 1, the first thing is purely on the on the basis of descriptive analytics. Right? So what they would do essentially is look into this particular data. Right? So descriptive analytics and diagnostic analytics are the basic blocks of analytics. If I consider analytics into 4 parts, descriptive, diagnostic, uh, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Right? So diagnostic descriptive and diagnostic was the first thing. So what they would do is, k, they would look into the center BI part itself, that thing which I had meant, uh, spoken about just now. So they would be maintaining the data flow, the data sanity, and creating dashboards. So that was the entire entire job profile. Right? So they'll be very hands on with the technical use of data data in terms of engineering as well as with the visualization part. They don't have to do anything else. Right? But it was the first part. The second part was your, uh, the second team, specifically, was the insights team, which would go deeper into things which were going wrong. Or if something was going high, uh, or any change in any particular metric, then they would look into this, uh, particular, uh, metric and try to solve them from anything that we give. Right? So they were very good problem solvers, and, uh, they can they used to query a little. And this is the second team that we built. So any problem that needs fixing, these guys would be the ones to go to. And the third thing was essentially, uh, advanced analytics thing, which was on the predictive and prescriptive side. They would build models altogether. Right? Say a framework, analytical framework, analytical model, or something which which which everyone nowadays call AI. Right? So so something on that particular front, this was the 3rd tip. So this is the team sizing and hiring. This is what we tried to do. We scaled up from a team size of around 5 people to around 35, 40 people, and and it'll be a really great journey. So this was what we did in in Verano. So hire first of all, setting up the business intelligence part, 1. And second, getting in those teams, defining, first of all, what, uh, the teams should be and hiring for those teams, uh, specifically the 3 teams that I mentioned. Right? The descriptive and diagnostic part of the of the team, which should look into b I part, which I had already mentioned. The, uh, insights team, which would essentially be a problem solvers in the team and look into all stakeholders and domains and try to only solve problems using data. And the, uh, third part is the predictive and prescriptive thing, which would continuously work on longer term projects, say 3 months, 6 months project, but because it would be incremental in nature. So, uh, so, uh, a company at the current level is doing business at this level because of this particular change. Of course, it'll take time, but it could suddenly jump out the business from 0 to a 1 or 1 or to a x. Right? So that's the kind of approach that we took in building these things. Right? So, roughly, that's what, uh, we used in Veranto. Similar story with Newton as well. And, uh, again, uh, built a business intelligence team where that's the first step. Then we tried to fit in or create teams or charters. Right? Analytical charters, what would fit into what exact, uh, what charters would essentially be needed for what part of growth in that particular analytics journey. For example, if I need the marketing sales marketing analytics team, sales analytics, and what kind of activity exactly I needed. And based on that, hiring for that particular, uh, individuals in the systems and and and and sorting them out and and finally delivering projects. So, uh, that's more or less what I wanted to say. So if you have any, uh, questions on this, I'd be happy to answer. In the tools front, specifically, we were using multiple tools, uh, simply for data ingestion. We were using air by air flow for wrangling and stuff. And data storing, we were using AWS, uh, Redshift. We were using AWS s s 3. Then, uh, for visualization, we were using, uh, Metabase, Tableau, Power BI as well. And, uh, mostly, these were the tools that were being used. For product analytics, we were also using Amplitude and Mixpanel to some extent. But these data were specifically getting ingested in versus 7, so we had a final visualization there, which was Tableau and Power BI itself. So that's it for this particular question. Thank you.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for that comprehensive overview. It's clear that you have a strong grasp on setting up data infrastructure and analytics teams. Now, let's talk about your hands-on experience with predictive frameworks and machine learning models. Could you describe a specific predictive model you built, the tools you used to build it, and how it impacted decision-making within the company? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. I can, uh, talk about the attribution framework that I built in, uh, with Antu. So, uh, when I was given this project, uh, all start ups, and not only with Antu, was hitting trying to hit profitability. Right? So my charter specifically was how can we drive, uh, towards profitability by increasing revenue growth. So revenue growth essentially means how can I uh, revenue has 22 broadly 2 levers to play with? Right? 1 is by you can you increase revenue by increasing your volume of sales? The other one is increasing ASP. Right? ASP was with a different guy. He was looking into this other set charter. My charter was specifically around how can I increase revenue by increasing volume of sales? Right? Now, uh, the first time when I got this okay. This was the first time for me, and then, uh, uh, I tried to look, uh, into things from a very basic level. Right? As in, like, uh, from a first principle point of view, when I looked into things, I understood, k, uh, you have all these marketing channels that you have paid. Right? So you have, say, Google, different forms of Google Google, in fact. I'd say, paid search, paid video, YouTube videos, uh, USA campaigns. Then you have, uh, your, uh, Facebook, YouTube, all these different paid channels, Google, uh, affiliates and stuff, all these paid channels, right, in one hand. And in the other hand, in the organic side, you have probably SEO, direct organic, uh, referrals, and stuff. Right? Uh, so what we usually when I looked into this data or this particular problem, we found, k, all you have all these marketing channels at one end, and you're spending money to to get in more users in terms of new acquisitions out of this, uh, from this particular channels. Right? Now problem is you are not able to at that point, we were not able to allocate the exact outcome of these channels in terms of the money that they were bringing in in the form of my final conversions. Right? I'll explain this. So as soon as, say, someone gets, uh, acquired by Google's this is, by the way, in Veranto. So Veranto is an ad tech company. Ad tech company means we are giving free lessons to my user base, my free users. And if they find a value proposition, they will convert to buy the final product, which is a paid product of, say, ASP 35 k. Right? So it's pretty expensive. Right? So, uh, they need to build consideration. Can that particular product is what they would, uh, be most suited for, and that would benefit them in their long run. Right? So, uh, usually, the conversion cycle the conversion meaning from a free user, they would finally convert into a paid user, right, which is essentially we will get money from. Right? That's how how our our salaries would be paid essentially. So, uh, this entire journey, since the ASP or the average selling price was quite high, the the consideration billing time frame was significantly high. Right? Say, for example, 15 days. Right? So I'll give you an example in from let's say x comes or you even come to my platform. I you you come by, let's say, looking into a, uh, you you got hit by Google search keyword. Right? And you you downloaded the app, and then you, uh, forgot to sign up. And then next day, you get get something, uh, in Facebook saying, k. Okay. Because I already have I tracked your GAIDs. Right? So I I tracked your GAIDs, and then I popped you a message saying, k. Okay. K. You can come and sign up. So the second hitting point is, k, you you are getting hit by, uh, another marketing source the 3rd day. So you have signed up, uh, and you're not watching anything. So I'm giving you a you're watching a YouTube video and suddenly a pop up comes up here. Okay. Every time, it comes up, right, for a master class. So you click the come you you watch the master class, then 4 day, 5 day, you have not not coming to 6 day. Push to a, uh, notification. Right? IPN or or probably proper SMS or an email saying, okay. You can come to my platform and then do this, this, this. So what I'm trying to say is over the speed of 15 days, you're getting bombarded by different stimuli from across multiple channels. Right? So channel 1, channel 2, channel 3, each channel. Right? Page channel can be page channel. It can be organic channel. Now what used to happen was, uh, each of these marketing channels had had a marketing manager, and they attributed it's a classic attribution problem. So each time someone got approached by this particular channel, they would count this user as their user in, uh, in their final outcome. For example, if I got or you got touched by, say, my, channel, which, let's say, Google search probably, and then you did multiple iterations over time, and then then you got bombarded by multiple metals from multiple channels. But you would finally get attributed to me my channel if I can say that from my part particular perspective being then me, my myself being my, uh, marketing manager. Right? So what used to happen was every marketing channel attributed or any touch mark marketing attributions. So anytime someone types the market the marketing channel, the dollar get to used to get in, uh, the attributed to that particular marketing channel. So what used to happen when I looked into this, this is crazy. Right? You could not understand where to invest money because, uh, at the end, you were getting only $100. But if you add up all these marketing channels' income, you're essentially gets the 500. Right? Because everyone is claiming it's here to the bank. So the best idea was to build a marketing framework, which would essentially tell exactly how much weightage should a particular marketing channel get over the course of time for that particular $1 if if the user is paying, how much should that particular user get, right, or that particular, uh, marketing channel get? So, uh, we the approach to it is we try to it's a little complex. I'll, anyway, explain it here. We we built, uh, we define what type of users it is. We built an, uh, attribution framework on the basis of weightages and stuff. Right? Proper weightages giving it to every every user, every type of user, being a new user, recurring user, lapsed user, or a, uh, old user. And then on the basis of this, on the basis of what exact stage of this particular user, we give gave them and waited in the forms of if you were the new user, you would get a true And we did, let's say, 50% for the 1st source. 2nd source is will get x, y, zed some some some time something of that sort. Right? So, uh, we tried, uh, 1st source attribution, last source attribution, LNDT, which is last nondirect touch. Right? Again, there's an interesting story behind it, but now I'll skip that. LNDT, we use multi touch at weighted averages and have different sorts of, uh, uh, attribution models. Finally, we fixed something which we created on our own, which was a very intricate detail of how exactly we created each of these weightages on the basis of sources, the type of customer, and which channels they were being pulled from. Right? So we've built this model. Uh, and this particular thing, the post the launch of this, uh, tuition model, the results are very surprising and very interesting. We found that 70% of our cost, in fact, was driving only around 10 to 15% of my revenue. What this essentially meant is that you can essentially cut down this 70% of cost altogether. Right? So, uh, you can reduce inefficiencies by 70%, and still your business would go down only by 10%, right, which is acceptable. Because now you have the 70% extra pool of money, which you can reinvest in this your growth levers. Right? The 30% of your cost which was giving around 90%. That's the opposite of that 70, uh, 70 10 ratio. Right? 30 90 ratio. Can invest in the other part and drive up growth. Right? So this was a game changer. And if you remember it with, uh, probably around 2021, there was a massive restructuring as well. So this one this is the same framework which we had built or I had built, my team had built. We we tried to post this discussion with the CEO, Vamsi. We completely, uh, decided to close all these different, uh, avenues which are not making profit or not making any any sense. Right? Who invest 70% of your resources and get only 30%. Right? Only only only 10% 10 to 15%, not 30. So so, uh, and, uh, we decided to cut down categories, marketing channels, and, hence, there was this massive, massive restructuring we ran to. We decided to invest in growth levers, and then we finally, uh, got very great results. Right? The metric that we were looking into in terms of efficiency was a metric called COCA. COCA is very simple, collections on the numerator. And on the denominator, you have, uh, your cost, which is a marketing and sales cost. Right? We were trying to make it 2. Why 2? Because, uh, my academic cost, because we're an education company. Right? Or the fulfillment cost itself was around 50%. So if you if we can maintain this coca ratio 2, we would be c m 2 positive. Right? So that was the, uh, c coca 2 was our goal, and we were trying to get there. At the start of this project, we were hovering at around 0.7. And, uh, post this, uh, framework launch, and, also, we did some cohorting as well, uh, which is a different project, so I'll not club it in this. We did cohorting, which is micro targeting at at every user level. At the in code level, I exactly knew what exactly those users wanted. Superimposing that with this. We drove it up to efficiency of our the coca metric around 2.2, which is brilliant because we were trying to, uh, get a COCA of 2. So we were in fact, in this particular terms, we are successful in turning this into profitability venture. So, yeah, that's how we decided to tackle the overall problem of, uh, ambiguity, uh, in in in decisioning. We used the framework, which is an attribution framework, which is a predictive analytics framework. And the result was we were able to uh, distinguish out very clearly what worked, what did not work in terms of putting our money in, and then stop these inefficiencies. And finally, uh, we were able to turn around the efficiency metric from 0.7 to 2.2. Uh, and our target was 2. We shot up at most 20%, 10%. So yeah. So that's how we tried this problem out and use this particular framework, analytical framework, to solve this particular issue, and we were successful.

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: The interview? Yes.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in both technical education and HR management. Can you tell me about a specific project where you utilized your technical skills to enhance HR processes or systems?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Uh, sure. I think, um, my recent, uh, job with SKU as a HR analyst is where I gained most of my hands on experience in HR. Right? So, uh, then we we, being a very small company, used to work majorly, uh, on Google Sheets and Notion, specifically for documentation and reporting and stuff like that. Right? So when we had a transition from using all of that into actually figuring out, uh, and implementing an HRIS tool and making sure, uh, it's adoption, uh, across the organization. That's where I think, uh, my technical skills kind of helped me in understanding which features were actually required for us as an organization, uh, which would be easy to use for, uh, uh, the employees and for the leadership in terms of the data they're looking for, in terms of the feasibility and ease of use that they would expect in the day to day usage. Right? So that's where I think, uh, this helped me in figuring out, uh, an HRIS system for our company and implementing it from end to end.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a great example of leveraging your technical acumen to improve HR operations. Transitioning to an HRIS can be quite complex. Can you elaborate on how you managed the change management process to ensure a smooth transition and high adoption rates among employees?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Sure. So the transition here, uh, was majorly triggered by the fact that, uh, uh, we fig we figured we noticed, uh, during one of our audits, uh, to improve processes and efficiency among the employees, wherein about, uh, for some of the stakeholders, 30 almost 30 hours per month was consumed by tasks like data entry, uh, updating sheets, and, uh, you know, just keeping track of data, which was scattered, uh, at multiple locations, uh, across multiple documents. Right? This was not a good practice. Also, there were challenges wherein, uh, you know, most of the communication, uh, for us, especially being a fully remote organization, would be over Slack. So anything that happens would be over a Slack message or a WhatsApp message at odd hours, which also hindered, uh, work life balance for a lot of employees. Right? So this so the idea of having an HRIS from an employee perspective was very important for us, uh, because it gave a lot of, uh, visibility around, say, for example, how many leaves do they have? Uh, if they have approved if they have applied for a leave, is it approved or not? They don't really have to do to and fro with the managers or, uh, with the HR leaders to keep track of that. Right? And likewise for the leaders as to, uh, uh, wherein they have a lot of visibility around, uh, what is the manpower in their team for that particular week so that they can plan things out accordingly. Right? So this solves their problems to the code wherein, uh, they don't really have a lot of to improve and enough visibility, uh, to operate smoothly. Right? So a lot of automation held here. Also, like I said, in terms of reporting and, uh, data that, uh, leadership usually prefers looking at while decision making. Right? So this is something wherein the leadership team was already aligned with. Uh, so I think, uh, overall, uh, because people realize that they had this problem and getting this into the picture, the HRIs into the picture would solve it for them, uh, Uh, they proactively were in the mindset to adopt and start using it. So people were enthusiastic about the idea. And to make it easier, what I also did was, like I said, uh, there was a whole process of training and, uh, making creating awareness among the employees as to how they can use it. Right? Although it's pretty simple and straightforward, uh, when you're using a new tool, you need some basic training. So that's where I pitched in, and I made sure that everybody received a basic training to, say, for example, uh, update the details, apply for leads, and, uh, download their payslips and stuff like that. I also created a handbook, which would give them, uh, an overview of, like, you know, what are the features they could use for certain scenarios. Say, for example, you want to appreciate an employee, uh, or one of the team members on the portal. Right? So so in front of the or, uh, in front of all the members of the company, in front of the entire organization, what are the features they could use? What are the badges we could create? So these are the kind of things which, uh, motivated them and, uh, gradually increase the adoption among the, um, employees, uh, in the company. Right?\\n\"], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you took a very proactive and comprehensive approach to change management, which is crucial for successful HRIS implementation. Your hands-on training and the creation of a handbook are excellent strategies for driving adoption. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you have experience in resolving employee complaints and grievances. Can you walk me through your approach to mediating a particularly challenging conflict between employees?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so to give you an example, um, one of the scenarios actually, most of the scenarios that we usually had, uh, was with respect to the sales and customer support team. Right? And, uh, there was this one scenario when there was some lead clash, uh, which had happened between 2 of our best performing individuals in the sales team. And, uh, to my surprise, uh, one of the members who actually raised the issue, um, mentioned that this had been raised multiple times before this, but there was nothing documented ever, like, you know, from their manager's end. A no action was taken to resolve it. Right? And this has been an ongoing issue had been an ongoing issue for almost, uh, 6 to 7 months before it came to me. Right? So, ideally, my, uh, my perspective is if it's a sales issue, if it's a process and policies issue, that's something which should be internally resolved by their sales manager and with their internal team. It should not be an HR issue. Right? But because it came to me, that's where I had to step in, and I had to coordinate with the sales manager to understand what's going on. And, uh, if at all it was reported previously, why wasn't it documented, and why hasn't it been resolved yet? Right? So, similarly, gaining perspective from both sides helped me understand, uh, where the gap was. And, um, thankfully, because I do have some experience in sales as well, um, during the early stages of my career, I could pitch in and I could figure out, uh, help them in creating some policies wherein, you know, the d day for the for the leads would be so and so, and post that, it would be transferred to so and so. So just helping them frame, uh, a policy which would, uh, which would at least to some extent, uh, make sure that these kind of clashes do not happen moving forward. Right? So that's what I did to resolve this.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to this conflict resolution is commendable, especially in how you collaborated with the sales manager to address the root cause and implement a policy to prevent future clashes. Given your experience in both HR and sales, how do you think this dual perspective has helped you in your role as an HR professional, particularly in understanding and addressing the needs of employees in a sales-driven environment?  \\n', \"Interviewee: That's a great question. Uh, so I think, uh, this experience that I have within sales has, uh, has really helped me in in a lot of ways. 1 is in understanding people, their mindset. So when you are on the other side of the table, uh, you do understand how employees think and they act and what to expect, uh, to some extent, uh, from the HR and from the management as well. Right? So this has helped me with, uh, with that, uh, respect. Also, um, like, being in a sales environment, I do understand something about, uh, leads and process, CRM management, and all of that. Right? So, yeah, I think, uh, this has helped me connect with the team to, uh, to a very critical, uh, level wherein, like, people trust me when I tell them that, hey. I have done this before, and I get you. I hear you when you say that. Uh, I understand this, and trust me, I'm going to figure it out. I have been there. Right? So it helps me build some credibility around, uh, what I'm speaking and, uh, for them to have basic trust in me that, you know, yeah, she she gets it. She she has also been through this and now she's in HR. So hopefully she's going to help us, right? So this is the sentiment that I that I usually engage in people, and I think this has helped me connect and, uh, build trust among employees and, uh, make sure that I that I leverage my relationships to, um, drive people in achieving their goals and making sure that they are motivated to perform. Right? So I think it's it's really helped me.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a valuable insight, and it's clear that your cross-functional experience has given you a unique advantage in building rapport and trust with employees. Your ability to relate to their experiences and speak from a place of understanding is a key strength in HR. Now, considering your technical background and your experience with process optimization, how do you stay current with HR technology and best practices, and how do you incorporate continuous learning into your role?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. So I think, um, like I said, process optimization is, uh, in my understanding, it's a very simple problem solving mechanism if you look at it. Right? Uh, it's typically identifying what are the existing process and, uh, where are the bottlenecks and then fixing things and optimizing things to make sure we have best efficiency possible. Right? So that's how I look at it. And, uh, to answer your question about, uh, best HR trends and technology and practices, I think, um, my go to place, uh, would always be Google and Charge GPT. Also, I do watch a lot of podcasts. So general podcast which help me understand, uh, a bit of knowledge about what's going on, especially in the startup ecosystem. And I do have, uh, my peers or, basically, my HR network in place wherein we discuss among ourselves and, we are like, hey, this is going on. Are you aware of this? Or I implemented this in my company. What do you think about this? So we exchange ideas and exchange knowledge. I think this is how I usually approach things. And, uh, whenever I need some feedback, I always look up to my my former HR managers or people who have relevant industry experience.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's great to hear that you're proactive in seeking out information and learning from various sources, including podcasts and industry peers. Leveraging your network and staying informed about the latest trends is essential in HR, especially when it comes to technology and best practices. Given your experience with process optimization, can you discuss a specific instance where you identified a bottleneck in an HR process and successfully implemented a solution to improve efficiency?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So I think, uh, with this, what comes to mind is the onboarding process that we previously had with one of my organizations. So what we noticed was the onboarding time was\\n'], ['Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a slight interruption. You were about to discuss the onboarding process and the onboarding time. Could you please continue with how you identified the bottleneck and the steps you took to improve the efficiency of the onboarding process?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Of course. So, um, yeah, like I was saying, uh, in one of our previous organizations, uh, I figured that the onboarding process, uh, could could use some some improvement, uh, considering, 1, the ramp up time for, uh, and this is particularly in respect to the sales team that I'm referring to. Right? So the onboarding, the ramp up time for the sales personnel took about some 5 to 6 months, which was surprisingly, um, really long in comparison with, uh, you know, what we usually see in the industry. So that, uh, also, uh, there was the the the approach to that to the whole training and onboarding process was very unstructured Wherein, you know, today, we finalize someone and, uh, the person is supposed to join us the next day. But because we do not have a structure in place, they would they would just not do anything for the 1st 3 days, and they were just sitting around and, uh, you know, it wasn't very effective. It wasn't very efficient as well. So this is where, uh, I figured that we should have, uh, a proper structure in place wherein we create a proper onboarding process. We mentioned, uh, what is to be done in day 0, day 3, day 5, and so on for the 1st 2 months. Uh, also, I made sure that all of these employees who were onboarded, uh, get got to got to learn from the peers, right, who had been in the system for at least more than 6 months. Right? So that's when I also introduced the buddy system wherein, like, uh, starting from starting from their offer acceptance, uh, that has been the sign, the joining letter with us, uh, until their, uh, you know, 1st 2 months in the organization were complete. They would be assigned a dedicated body from their own team who would be the point for any questions with the product, with the process, the system that they are using, any queries in general which is related to their work or which could improve their work, basically. Right? So I think this really helped us create a smooth, uh, onboarding process for the employees, also providing them a good candidate experience. Uh, and we noticed that eventually the ramp up time reduced, uh, from 5 to 6 months, which was the which was the previous, uh, time frame to about 3 months. Right? And this was a major, uh, major achievement, I would say, in terms of processes.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant improvement in the onboarding process, reducing the ramp-up time by half. The structured approach and the buddy system are excellent strategies for enhancing the new employee experience and accelerating their integration into the team. How did you measure the success of these changes, and what feedback did you receive from the sales team and the new hires after implementing the new onboarding process?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. So the measurement was typically, uh, based on, uh, the sales numbers that that we usually saw. So say, for example, the target would be, uh, for example, you have to close 10 units in a month. Right? So if that is the target and we saw people usually, you know, achieving that number by the 5th month in the company, this used, uh, this eventually happened towards the 3rd month in the company. Right? So that's how we figured that, okay, this is not this is working probably, and that is why people are able to perform, uh, in a lesser span. Right? And considering the feedback from employees, uh, I think employees were very happy. They they really felt happy that everything starting from the sales training to, like, you know, when would be the, uh, going for the sales training because these used to happen in person. So starting from everything, coordinating with them for the flights, with their, uh, stays, and, uh, with with the structured 3 day training program that we had in place to assigning their buddy wherein they could just go to their buddy and they could ask them, uh, about this and that and stuff, and they do not have to, like, sit and wait for the manager to be available. Right? So because the managers had a lot of work, and they also were in a way the bottleneck, um, uh, in terms of availability for these new joinings. Right? So that was not the case anymore. So I think overall, the employees were very happy about the new process, and they liked it.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear that the new onboarding process not only improved the efficiency of the sales team but also had a positive impact on employee satisfaction. The tangible results in sales performance and the anecdotal feedback from employees are both strong indicators of success. Given the success of this initiative, how do you approach the challenge of scaling such improvements to accommodate a larger influx of new hires or a growing sales team?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Alright. So, uh, to answer your question, uh, we, uh, we were a very small company. So at any point in time, the company's strength would not be more than 75 employees at best, uh, out of which about, uh, 35 or 40 employees would be in sales. Right? And, uh, like I said, uh, we introduced the buddy system, right, uh, for, uh, these new journeys. And I think the body system is something which is, uh, which really works well. It's also it's also a way for us to gauge, um, the potential the leadership potential in the existing employees. Right? Because, um, you or, you know, like, when you create these things for new employees, obviously, it improves their experience. But for the existing employees, when you hand them over with some, uh, some added responsibilities, that's when you actually see them feeling motivated and them feeling more into, uh, their work because they now know that they are responsible and accountable for somebody else. Right? So it's also a way for us to, uh, tap into the leadership potential, into our existing team members. And, uh, over a period of time, you know, promote them maybe to a team leader or, like, an assistant manager or some other roles, which would end on, uh, you know, create a major impact wherein, uh, they are capable of handling more than 5 or 6 buddies at one time. And they are also capable of, uh, showcasing their, uh, management skills or their reading abilities. Right? So I think it's a win win.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: The buddy system not only enhances the onboarding experience for new hires but also serves as a leadership development tool for existing employees. It's a smart way to identify and nurture potential leaders within the organization. As you look to scale this approach, how do you ensure that the existing team members who take on the role of a buddy are adequately prepared and supported in their new responsibilities, and what kind of training or guidance do you provide to them?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Okay. That's a great question. So one is, uh, because they're starting up with 1 or 2 buddies initially, and, uh, they could expect a promotion in about 6 to 7 months, uh, right, later. Right? So that that provides them with some bandwidth as to what they can expect at the day to day. And, uh, additionally, what what we also feel is, uh, having these these sessions wherein we bring, uh, the existing older employees, uh, to the training programs, which happen, uh, which happen in person, right, for the new joinees would be a great way to showcase, uh, you know, how the sales managers, uh, are conducting these training sessions, how do they, um, how do they tackle these new joinees, what are the kind of data they look into, and, uh, what kind of conversations they have. So, basically, when when these, um, when these existing employees, the buddies, when they get to shadow their, uh, their sales managers or, uh, you know, they get to see, like, how they are taking care of their team. That's when they get a sense of what is expected out of them as well. Right? That's a great way to learn, sharing their own sales managers and learning step by step. Also, another another great way to, uh, inculcate leadership training would be, uh, making sure we we provide them sufficient access and support to be a part of relevant industry events and, uh, understand what's going on and be be a part of that, uh, make sure that their their inputs, their voice is good, um, in those kind of events and in internal meetings as well. This gives them a lot of confidence and credibility in their abilities as well. Right? So I think this is how we would make sure that the current team is prepared to take on leadership roles moving ahead.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

And proper problems in, uh, early level start ups is key. You have lots of data, but you don't know exactly which data is correct. And leadership specifically is not our key on how to, uh, make decisions out of this, uh, improper data. Right? Because there are key issues with data inconsistency only mainly. And second thing is key, uh, everyone everyone kind of uses this particular data. Right? So so it becomes very difficult to make decisions, quality decisions, out of this, uh, this data. So what I did initially was, uh, we built a, uh, 3 it's a 3 part system. The first part is focused around the data engineering part, where we kind of, uh, segregated all the different data sources that we have. In terms of data sources, let's say you can have data internally being from of Mongo. You can have, uh, data in in some CRM like a Salesforce or a LeadSquared, or you can have product analytics, uh, softwares or tools, API connections where you store data. Right? Now what we did was, uh, we kind of filtered all this data using Airbyte and Airflow. We transferred them into Redshift, which is AWS. Right? Uh, Data warehouse. Uh, we use Redshift because it stores data very efficiently in the form of columnar database. It's because it's a columnar database. And, uh, this was the first step. The second stage was, uh, the data analytics well apart. Where we what we did was we segregated this data that we have collated from all the different sources that you have into a specific, uh, DB, which we call the data layer. And this layer essentially had all fact and dimension tables on Fact and dimension tables, meaning, I'll say, you have a user fact, which is a fact table at the user level, but that users are describing that, and the transaction tables, which is a transaction table. So a very standard definition of metrics and definitions. Metrics and dimensions is what we created. This was the 2nd layer. And the 3rd layer which we built on top of it is the aggregation layer, what we called the, uh, reporting layer. We aggregated all these numbers or all these features that we had or metrics that we had and, uh, reported proper aggregations in this particular, uh, layer. We re we stored everything in that particular layer. And this part these were the 3 steps. And this particular final stage, the reporting layer, the ARL is what we call analytics reporting layer, was connected to BI tool. In our case, the BI tool was the business intelligence, uh, very popular business intelligence tool called Tableau. We, uh, onboarded and and and maybe started it from scratch, uh, build dashboards on top of it. So the entire problem which we had at the beginning, right, data quality issue, the inconsistency, and, uh, specifically, data not being available quickly. Right? Those problems are solved because everyone started from the CEO to the very end. Right? To end stakeholders as in, like, some executives. Right? They had access to this quality data at their fingertips because everything was smooth line, uh, and, uh, everything was stored in a very efficient way. And if you just wanted to query anything, you can just you don't even have to query. You can go to the dashboards and and get that particular number. And the good part was key, it was very efficient in terms of, uh, pulling out numbers very quickly. So it improved decision making by making data available faster. And the second thing was the data consistency was there, so there was no discrepancy in taking any decisions. Right? Because everyone was there what data was saying. Specifically, if there was a problem in terms of, say, number drop, RCA could be done very easily. Even if there were some high highs, then you can exactly know what's contributing to the high highs. Right? So so this entire process took a big, uh, significant amount of time, some 6 months' time, And we finally made this particular, uh, entire part where we could, uh, streamline the data part in the analytics journey. Right? The second part was, of course, building a team, um, in in in the system because analytics journeys always have two important things. 1 is the data part. The second one is teams. And the third one is a mix of both where you align the proper team to the all resources, human resources to the to the to the projects or or to the data. Right? So the first part is what I had explained right now, getting in the data, sorting the pipelines, and the business intelligence framework is what we built in the first part, which I had just said. 2nd part was getting the team. We tried to follow an Airbnb model here where you have 3 distinct things. 1, the first thing is purely on the on the basis of descriptive analytics. Right? So what they would do essentially is look into this particular data. Right? So descriptive analytics and diagnostic analytics are the basic blocks of analytics. If I consider analytics into 4 parts, descriptive, diagnostic, uh, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Right? So diagnostic descriptive and diagnostic was the first thing. So what they would do is, k, they would look into the center BI part itself, that thing which I had meant, uh, spoken about just now. So they would be maintaining the data flow, the data sanity, and creating dashboards. So that was the entire entire job profile. Right? So they'll be very hands on with the technical use of data data in terms of engineering as well as with the visualization part. They don't have to do anything else. Right? But it was the first part. The second part was your, uh, the second team, specifically, was the insights team, which would go deeper into things which were going wrong. Or if something was going high, uh, or any change in any particular metric, then they would look into this, uh, particular, uh, metric and try to solve them from anything that we give. Right? So they were very good problem solvers, and, uh, they can they used to query a little. And this is the second team that we built. So any problem that needs fixing, these guys would be the ones to go to. And the third thing was essentially, uh, advanced analytics thing, which was on the predictive and prescriptive side. They would build models altogether. Right? Say a framework, analytical framework, analytical model, or something which which which everyone nowadays call AI. Right? So so something on that particular front, this was the 3rd tip. So this is the team sizing and hiring. This is what we tried to do. We scaled up from a team size of around 5 people to around 35, 40 people, and and it'll be a really great journey. So this was what we did in in Verano. So hire first of all, setting up the business intelligence part, 1. And second, getting in those teams, defining, first of all, what, uh, the teams should be and hiring for those teams, uh, specifically the 3 teams that I mentioned. Right? The descriptive and diagnostic part of the of the team, which should look into b I part, which I had already mentioned. The, uh, insights team, which would essentially be a problem solvers in the team and look into all stakeholders and domains and try to only solve problems using data. And the, uh, third part is the predictive and prescriptive thing, which would continuously work on longer term projects, say 3 months, 6 months project, but because it would be incremental in nature. So, uh, so, uh, a company at the current level is doing business at this level because of this particular change. Of course, it'll take time, but it could suddenly jump out the business from 0 to a 1 or 1 or to a x. Right? So that's the kind of approach that we took in building these things. Right? So, roughly, that's what, uh, we used in Veranto. Similar story with Newton as well. And, uh, again, uh, built a business intelligence team where that's the first step. Then we tried to fit in or create teams or charters. Right? Analytical charters, what would fit into what exact, uh, what charters would essentially be needed for what part of growth in that particular analytics journey. For example, if I need the marketing sales marketing analytics team, sales analytics, and what kind of activity exactly I needed. And based on that, hiring for that particular, uh, individuals in the systems and and and and sorting them out and and finally delivering projects. So, uh, that's more or less what I wanted to say. So if you have any, uh, questions on this, I'd be happy to answer. In the tools front, specifically, we were using multiple tools, uh, simply for data ingestion. We were using air by air flow for wrangling and stuff. And data storing, we were using AWS, uh, Redshift. We were using AWS s s 3. Then, uh, for visualization, we were using, uh, Metabase, Tableau, Power BI as well. And, uh, mostly, these were the tools that were being used. For product analytics, we were also using Amplitude and Mixpanel to some extent. But these data were specifically getting ingested in versus 7, so we had a final visualization there, which was Tableau and Power BI itself. So that's it for this particular question. Thank you.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for that comprehensive overview. It's clear that you have a strong grasp on setting up data infrastructure and analytics teams. Now, let's talk about your hands-on experience with predictive frameworks and machine learning models. Could you describe a specific predictive model you built, the tools you used to build it, and how it impacted decision-making within the company? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. I can, uh, talk about the attribution framework that I built in, uh, with Antu. So, uh, when I was given this project, uh, all start ups, and not only with Antu, was hitting trying to hit profitability. Right? So my charter specifically was how can we drive, uh, towards profitability by increasing revenue growth. So revenue growth essentially means how can I uh, revenue has 22 broadly 2 levers to play with? Right? 1 is by you can you increase revenue by increasing your volume of sales? The other one is increasing ASP. Right? ASP was with a different guy. He was looking into this other set charter. My charter was specifically around how can I increase revenue by increasing volume of sales? Right? Now, uh, the first time when I got this okay. This was the first time for me, and then, uh, uh, I tried to look, uh, into things from a very basic level. Right? As in, like, uh, from a first principle point of view, when I looked into things, I understood, k, uh, you have all these marketing channels that you have paid. Right? So you have, say, Google, different forms of Google Google, in fact. I'd say, paid search, paid video, YouTube videos, uh, USA campaigns. Then you have, uh, your, uh, Facebook, YouTube, all these different paid channels, Google, uh, affiliates and stuff, all these paid channels, right, in one hand. And in the other hand, in the organic side, you have probably SEO, direct organic, uh, referrals, and stuff. Right? Uh, so what we usually when I looked into this data or this particular problem, we found, k, all you have all these marketing channels at one end, and you're spending money to to get in more users in terms of new acquisitions out of this, uh, from this particular channels. Right? Now problem is you are not able to at that point, we were not able to allocate the exact outcome of these channels in terms of the money that they were bringing in in the form of my final conversions. Right? I'll explain this. So as soon as, say, someone gets, uh, acquired by Google's this is, by the way, in Veranto. So Veranto is an ad tech company. Ad tech company means we are giving free lessons to my user base, my free users. And if they find a value proposition, they will convert to buy the final product, which is a paid product of, say, ASP 35 k. Right? So it's pretty expensive. Right? So, uh, they need to build consideration. Can that particular product is what they would, uh, be most suited for, and that would benefit them in their long run. Right? So, uh, usually, the conversion cycle the conversion meaning from a free user, they would finally convert into a paid user, right, which is essentially we will get money from. Right? That's how how our our salaries would be paid essentially. So, uh, this entire journey, since the ASP or the average selling price was quite high, the the consideration billing time frame was significantly high. Right? Say, for example, 15 days. Right? So I'll give you an example in from let's say x comes or you even come to my platform. I you you come by, let's say, looking into a, uh, you you got hit by Google search keyword. Right? And you you downloaded the app, and then you, uh, forgot to sign up. And then next day, you get get something, uh, in Facebook saying, k. Okay. Because I already have I tracked your GAIDs. Right? So I I tracked your GAIDs, and then I popped you a message saying, k. Okay. K. You can come and sign up. So the second hitting point is, k, you you are getting hit by, uh, another marketing source the 3rd day. So you have signed up, uh, and you're not watching anything. So I'm giving you a you're watching a YouTube video and suddenly a pop up comes up here. Okay. Every time, it comes up, right, for a master class. So you click the come you you watch the master class, then 4 day, 5 day, you have not not coming to 6 day. Push to a, uh, notification. Right? IPN or or probably proper SMS or an email saying, okay. You can come to my platform and then do this, this, this. So what I'm trying to say is over the speed of 15 days, you're getting bombarded by different stimuli from across multiple channels. Right? So channel 1, channel 2, channel 3, each channel. Right? Page channel can be page channel. It can be organic channel. Now what used to happen was, uh, each of these marketing channels had had a marketing manager, and they attributed it's a classic attribution problem. So each time someone got approached by this particular channel, they would count this user as their user in, uh, in their final outcome. For example, if I got or you got touched by, say, my, channel, which, let's say, Google search probably, and then you did multiple iterations over time, and then then you got bombarded by multiple metals from multiple channels. But you would finally get attributed to me my channel if I can say that from my part particular perspective being then me, my myself being my, uh, marketing manager. Right? So what used to happen was every marketing channel attributed or any touch mark marketing attributions. So anytime someone types the market the marketing channel, the dollar get to used to get in, uh, the attributed to that particular marketing channel. So what used to happen when I looked into this, this is crazy. Right? You could not understand where to invest money because, uh, at the end, you were getting only $100. But if you add up all these marketing channels' income, you're essentially gets the 500. Right? Because everyone is claiming it's here to the bank. So the best idea was to build a marketing framework, which would essentially tell exactly how much weightage should a particular marketing channel get over the course of time for that particular $1 if if the user is paying, how much should that particular user get, right, or that particular, uh, marketing channel get? So, uh, we the approach to it is we try to it's a little complex. I'll, anyway, explain it here. We we built, uh, we define what type of users it is. We built an, uh, attribution framework on the basis of weightages and stuff. Right? Proper weightages giving it to every every user, every type of user, being a new user, recurring user, lapsed user, or a, uh, old user. And then on the basis of this, on the basis of what exact stage of this particular user, we give gave them and waited in the forms of if you were the new user, you would get a true And we did, let's say, 50% for the 1st source. 2nd source is will get x, y, zed some some some time something of that sort. Right? So, uh, we tried, uh, 1st source attribution, last source attribution, LNDT, which is last nondirect touch. Right? Again, there's an interesting story behind it, but now I'll skip that. LNDT, we use multi touch at weighted averages and have different sorts of, uh, uh, attribution models. Finally, we fixed something which we created on our own, which was a very intricate detail of how exactly we created each of these weightages on the basis of sources, the type of customer, and which channels they were being pulled from. Right? So we've built this model. Uh, and this particular thing, the post the launch of this, uh, tuition model, the results are very surprising and very interesting. We found that 70% of our cost, in fact, was driving only around 10 to 15% of my revenue. What this essentially meant is that you can essentially cut down this 70% of cost altogether. Right? So, uh, you can reduce inefficiencies by 70%, and still your business would go down only by 10%, right, which is acceptable. Because now you have the 70% extra pool of money, which you can reinvest in this your growth levers. Right? The 30% of your cost which was giving around 90%. That's the opposite of that 70, uh, 70 10 ratio. Right? 30 90 ratio. Can invest in the other part and drive up growth. Right? So this was a game changer. And if you remember it with, uh, probably around 2021, there was a massive restructuring as well. So this one this is the same framework which we had built or I had built, my team had built. We we tried to post this discussion with the CEO, Vamsi. We completely, uh, decided to close all these different, uh, avenues which are not making profit or not making any any sense. Right? Who invest 70% of your resources and get only 30%. Right? Only only only 10% 10 to 15%, not 30. So so, uh, and, uh, we decided to cut down categories, marketing channels, and, hence, there was this massive, massive restructuring we ran to. We decided to invest in growth levers, and then we finally, uh, got very great results. Right? The metric that we were looking into in terms of efficiency was a metric called COCA. COCA is very simple, collections on the numerator. And on the denominator, you have, uh, your cost, which is a marketing and sales cost. Right? We were trying to make it 2. Why 2? Because, uh, my academic cost, because we're an education company. Right? Or the fulfillment cost itself was around 50%. So if you if we can maintain this coca ratio 2, we would be c m 2 positive. Right? So that was the, uh, c coca 2 was our goal, and we were trying to get there. At the start of this project, we were hovering at around 0.7. And, uh, post this, uh, framework launch, and, also, we did some cohorting as well, uh, which is a different project, so I'll not club it in this. We did cohorting, which is micro targeting at at every user level. At the in code level, I exactly knew what exactly those users wanted. Superimposing that with this. We drove it up to efficiency of our the coca metric around 2.2, which is brilliant because we were trying to, uh, get a COCA of 2. So we were in fact, in this particular terms, we are successful in turning this into profitability venture. So, yeah, that's how we decided to tackle the overall problem of, uh, ambiguity, uh, in in in decisioning. We used the framework, which is an attribution framework, which is a predictive analytics framework. And the result was we were able to uh, distinguish out very clearly what worked, what did not work in terms of putting our money in, and then stop these inefficiencies. And finally, uh, we were able to turn around the efficiency metric from 0.7 to 2.2. Uh, and our target was 2. We shot up at most 20%, 10%. So yeah. So that's how we tried this problem out and use this particular framework, analytical framework, to solve this particular issue, and we were successful.

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: You? Yes. I am. Thank you.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at Rampiva Legal. You mentioned signing the company's first vendor channel partner. Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced in establishing this partnership and how you overcame them?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, a channel partner, as you probably know, is the partner that's gonna sell your product for you. And, uh, in this particular instance, uh, there was a a company that was consulting with other law firms and other companies, mostly other companies in the in the construction field. And, uh, they processed with the same processing engine, which is Nuix. And, uh, I knew some people there. So I was able to take my personal relationship with them as, uh, as an in, if you will, you know, establishing some trust based on our our prior relationship, our prior performance. And, uh, uh, yeah, I was able to start talking to them. And after, uh, they agreed to take a look at the product, vet it, uh, the the product spoke for itself. It's a good product, and they were happy with it. So it it overcame that kind of initial resistance of, um, offering something they hadn't offered before.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant achievement. When it came to vetting the product, how did you address any concerns the partner may have had about integrating Rampiva's solution with their existing workflow, especially considering the unique needs of the construction industry?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Well, more properly, the unique workflow is the Nuix processing engine. Nuix is an engine that processes data in the discovery. It then goes into a hosting review platform and a number of AI and and tar tools as well.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a thoughtful approach to addressing these concerns. Can you elaborate on the technical aspects of integrating Rampiva's solution with the partner's existing workflow, particularly how you communicated this to the partner to build trust in the solution's compatibility?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. And I I guess to preface that by saying, I'm not the the technical, uh, consultant on that. I understand the technology, but, uh, you know, at that fine level, we have, uh, uh, subject matter experts. But the key thing here is that, uh, when Nuix processes, it's a very powerful tool, but it's a very cludgy tool. It's very difficult and very high maintenance. So when it came to integrating with their workflow, what we're able to show them is you have this very complicated workflow, uh, uh, in order to take advantage of all the, uh, the firepower, all the technology that you have in in processing. And by using the Rampiva, you're gonna get more out of it easier. So, uh, it's easier for staffing, uh, it's easier in terms of budgeting. And, you know, the key the key thing that grease the wheel, if you will, is that, uh, it allowed them to make far more efficient and economic use of something they already had.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the high-level technical aspects is definitely crucial for effective sales. Shifting focus a bit, in your role at Ryley Carlock & Applewhite, you led a team of approximately 8 members in eDiscovery and Managed Review. Can you discuss a specific challenge you faced in leading this team and how you addressed it?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, I think the biggest problem that team had was their value proposition, if you will. That's what makes what they were doing better than what other people doing the same thing were. So for example, their their value\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding and differentiating the value proposition is key. How did you work with your team to clearly define and communicate this value proposition to both internal stakeholders and clients, ensuring everyone was aligned on the unique selling points of your services?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think internally, uh, they understood it, uh, instinctively, but they didn't really, uh, were able to, you know, render it into something that was easily described. The the value statement for Riley Kerlock's managed review is that it was a law firm quality review, uh, at a discount price. There's different levels of review in the managed review business. You can get, you know, quick, cheap, and dirty overseas. You can get highly technical for things like IP and patent that is very expensive. So they were kind of, um, that law firm level review. That's a good level of review, a sophisticated level review, but kind of at a bargain price. So one of the problems they were having is they were, uh, competing for projects that didn't align with where their value proposition was. Some of them were either too technical or some of them were either, uh, uh, too cheap. They didn't need the value that we had, so they didn't need to pay for it. So the thing to get them working properly was to align, uh, the targets, align the the targets potential customers with the offering that we had. And the way that is done is by, uh, coming up with a marketing plan that targets the right kind of client. The client who, if they were in a position to say yes, it would make sense for them to do so. And that that kind of uncorked the dam and allowed them to start expanding.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Aligning the target market with your value proposition is crucial for business growth. Can you detail the specific components of the marketing plan that helped realign your target clients and expand your business in the right direction?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: No. I think I I think I have to a degree, but I can I can kind of reencapsulate them if you will? Uh, we were looking for clients that needed attorney level review. And, you know, review doesn't have to be done by attorneys. It can also be done by very sophisticated subject matter experts. So we were looking for certain types of review. Usually, a construction, as I've cited, is is 1, general business litigation, you know, things like this. By identifying the, uh, where our values showed up the best, we were able to go and look at practice groups and law firms and go, okay. They do the kind of work that is the kind of work that we're looking for. So by talking to them, we can discuss projects they've had or may have that, uh, could benefit from getting that attorney quality review at a lower price. That makes them more cost effective and more competitive with their clients.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Identifying practice groups and engaging with them to discuss specific projects is a targeted approach. How did you leverage technology or data analytics to identify these practice groups and evaluate the potential fit of their projects with your service offering, ensuring a more data-driven and efficient client acquisition process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: There's a number of ways to do that. Um, you have to kind of look in 2 large different categories. Larger law firms have a series of practice groups. They'll have some practice groups that are good targets and some that aren't. So if you look at the a law firm, you might say, well, some of this law firm isn't a good practice for is it a good target for me? But if I look at this law firm, if I look at the information that's available through various sources or even going as simple as going to a firm's website and saying, okay. What practice groups do they have? Are these practice groups that are good for us? They are. Then let's reach out to them. Then that's for kind of a general purpose law firm. The the second approach, uh, of kind of leveraging, I guess, you could say analytics, is looking for firms that specialize in these fields. And, yeah, there's a number of tools that are available for that that are relatively simple. And if you've been in the business marketplace for law long enough, there's some that are gonna come to mind. So that kinda gave us a good idea of who to target.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the different approaches to targeting law firms and specialized firms is insightful. Can you delve into the specific tools or methodologies you used to evaluate the fit of a practice group or a specialized firm, perhaps highlighting a tool or strategy that particularly stood out for its effectiveness in this process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I'd have to say it's not so much a tool because they're not that difficult to identify. You can look at a firm's website, or you can look at, you know, what type of law firm it is. It might say, we specialize in construction or mass tort or whatever it might be. Um, but I think it's more of an approach. Right? Uh, what was helpful in that instance was in identifying, uh, firms that did that kind of work was, uh, taking a consultative approach. And that's, I think, you know, the thing that you're asking, right, is what what process do you use? And in a consultative approach, we're gonna ask a lot of questions. We're gonna be lawyerly ourselves. We're gonna ask them about what they do and how they do it and where their pain points are and see if their pain points align with the offering that we have. If they do, we've gone a long way, uh, down the process of identifying someone who could be motivated to purchase our services. So that that takes, um, you know, some some some digging. And more importantly, it takes some listening rather than, you know, letting them talk rather than than you talk at them. Let them explain what their problems are. So I think a key thing there is the consultative approach.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The consultative approach to client engagement is indeed a powerful strategy for identifying alignment and addressing pain points. How do you ensure scalability of this consultative approach across your sales and client services teams, especially as the business grows and the number of engagements increases?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, the, you know, the number of engagements can increase. The size of the individual engagements tends to remain more constant, at least in the business that I was in. But even in businesses where it's not, right, some law firms might have, 1 or 2 projects a year. Some might have 1 or 2 a month. Um, it's simply a matter of asking the right questions to the white people, and then encouraging to provide you with the information where you can then go to your solution. You can go to your well of information and say, hey. I can help you here. You've laid out to me what you're doing and how you're doing it and where where the pain points are or you know, with a consultative approach, they may not realize they have pain points. They might be doing something and thinking, yeah, it works fine, when you're like, wow, they don't really realize this could be done much more efficiently. So, uh, that's, uh, you know, in terms of scalability, I think it it's simply a matter of, uh, whether the whether it's a large target or a small target, the approach and the process is the same. Of course, as you expand and you add more people, you have more people doing it. So, uh, you know, there's a practical limit, I think, ultimately to how much one person can can juggle. And that varies on a lot of factors that, you know, probably aren't worth going into right now about about the particular business itself.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the consistency in approach regardless of the size of the engagement is important. What kind of tools or methodologies do you envision implementing to help your teams better capture, analyze, and utilize client data to enhance the effectiveness of the consultative approach at scale?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think what kind of tools or processes would I would I, uh, use? I think, you know, part of it is teaching people to listen, teaching them to not just talk at clients of, hey. I have this, this, and this to sell. A lot of people try to I guess they call it feature sell. It's like, this is all the neat stuff that we have, and isn't it great? The problem that you can run into is that your stuff might be great, but if they don't have a need for it, you're wasting each other's time. So I think training might be, uh, one of the key things is teaching people what questions to ask, techniques to get people talking, and identify the right people to talk to and getting them to provide you, uh, the information in a in a give and take. You know, my background is an attorney. Attorneys are are trained to ask questions. Um, and I think people think, you know, they're trained to ask tricky questions, but we're not. We're really trained to ask questions to try to get to the truth of a point or matter. So, you know, there's a a variety of training programs available, but I think that's kind of the key thing is having people who are trained in the consultative approach that know how to use a consultative approach, how to implement it by the type of questions they ask and the process by which they go about their engagement. I think that's the key, and that's the thing that allows you to expand the scalability. And, you know, you can always expand the number of people, uh, on a particular project. You know, you might have a a smaller project and, uh, uh, you know, one person can handle it. But on a larger project, just prospect, you might wanna bring in some subject matter experts. There might be more stakeholders in this in this larger, uh, project. You know, there's a lot of factors that are I hate to sound lawyerly. It's one of those kind of it depends questions. Uh, but, uh, it it depends on a a lot of factors that we that we don't know as you and I are sitting here talking right now about what would what would make us determine what we need to put that consultative approach into effect.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Training and developing a questioning mindset are indeed foundational. Considering the role of technology in augmenting human capabilities, are there any specific data analytics or client relationship management (CRM) tools you believe could complement the consultative approach, especially in identifying nuanced client needs or patterns across engagements?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, these these tools are expanding by the day. Um, you know, for example, I've used the CRM called HubSpot and there there was a time when you were, uh, identifying potential prospect, you have to input manually lots of data about this prospect, you know, what their addresses, phone numbers, you know, uh, you know, information. With HubSpot, um, if you type in their web domain, it'll automatically populate all that information. And a lot of that is information that's useful to you in a consultative approach to go, wow. This is the customers they have. This is the business they have. This is, you know, the numbers they have. This is the growth or declining growth that they have. Um, you know, here's, uh, you know, Wall Street Journal articles, uh, you know, um, you know, the the use of of AI and a lot of these more advanced tools, I think where they really help, uh, it's not that they're better or that humans are worse. Um, I think they're better at some things and worse at others. But the key thing is how do they work together? Uh, I think that's important in the legal space. You know, with attorneys, it's, uh, you know, they tend to be a little off putting, uh, towards a lot of technology. But you have to explain to them and show them how this is a tool just like a a law book was, a typewriter, a pen, or a pencil. Uh, and they're they have to know how to use this tool in order to do their job. And, uh, you know, the\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: HubSpot's automation for data input is indeed a time-saver, especially in the initial stages of prospecting. As you've mentioned the use of AI in more advanced tools, how do you see AI being integrated into the consultative approach, perhaps in terms of analyzing client data or suggesting relevant lines of questioning based on patterns identified in the data?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: I think that's that's it right there is, uh, in the consultative approach, the more you know going in, uh, and when I say the more you know, um, there's things that you can concretely know. You know, what a company's revenues are, that's a that's a concrete number. What a company's perception is is not. So, uh, you know, I think the advantage of these tools and the way they can help in the consultative approach is they can provide you information like, you know, are their revenues stagnant? Are they growing? Are they shrinking? You know, this would be helpful, you know, when the when you're consultative approach. You'd say, I see that your business has been on a decline. This practice group, your your revenues have been falling. Um, why do you think that is? Let them tell you. You know, um, the machine, uh, learning there can help suggest the course of action. You know, um, in the actual legal work itself, uh, there's things like technology assisted review that help narrow down out of this massive information. They'll narrow down, um, documents along a certain theme. And the more that you select certain types of inputs, the more it'll deliver those inputs. So I think that's one way that it can help. But I think the key thing is, uh, the the person and the and the artificial intelligence working collaboratively, um, is greater than either one of them as an individual. And the, uh, ability to help provide factual basis to your questions that are gonna be the core of your consultation, I think, is probably the key there.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging AI to understand and interpret less concrete aspects, such as a company's trajectory, is indeed a powerful application in the consultative approach. How do you envision ensuring that the human-AI collaboration remains transparent and understandable to your team, so they can effectively incorporate AI-generated insights into their client engagements?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, I think there's a couple things I think. It has to it has to have a track record right as you use it. It needs to be solid. If the AI is giving you information that says this company is on a downward trajectory and it's on an upward trajectory that's going to cause a problem. I think just like a human being everything is always in a state of flux. It's in a state of growth and evolution and adjustments. So there might be situations where AI makes mistakes now ai doesn't make mistakes the way maybe I would of Simply being wrong, but it is subject to the the garbage in garbage or problem to a certain degree. So you is that happens? I think a process where We acknowledge that this can happen and that it doesn't AI tells us something it doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to do something on our own. I think of this process of Correction adjustment and increased learning is known and open and followed then I think you know people will work with it better just like they would a person or do the same circumstances\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yeah, I am start.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see you're currently pursuing your Prince2 Foundation & Practitioner certification. Can you tell me how this certification is helping you enhance your project management skills, and perhaps give an example of how you've applied Prince2 methodologies in your current role? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure, John, so basically as I mentioned I am pursuing Prince to certification from Simply learn. So this course is basically consists of four integrated elements one is principal themes tailoring to project environment and processes. So this particular course is helping me out in order to give up the descriptive view how exactly a project is managed. For example, there are certain principles which is going which is which has been taught into prints two, which is like continuous business justification. There should be defined roles and responsibilities. So there are seven principles they have listed down. So how I can apply it. Let's say I can give an example about continued business justification, which is one one principle of prince2. So first of all what this principal tells us, the is the business whatever project on which we are working is that project is viable and enough it every interval. Off that project timeline. So the this particular principle is helping me out to continuously regularly check that whether my project is viable or not viable, which means whether in terms of money is it Are we going in the right direction or not? In terms of resources are my resources are allocated on a right project or a scope of that project on are they working on some other kind of scope are they deviated? Is there any tolerance in that project which needs to be understood which needs to be managed earlier before starting the project. This is one example of principle, which is going to be used in this Prince to project another example. I wish I can give you is about the processes. There are seven processes in a place to certification like starting up a project directing a project initiated then managing stage boundaries managing product delivery controlling a stage and closing a project. So this particular process is helping me out in order to understand how to design the entire stage plan for any project. Let's say if I talk about starting up a project where it is basically explains about the project brief. Which means what all basic criteria is required whenever you are managing any project, let's say it can be a risk management. It can be a resource allocation. It can be what kind of Technologies are required. It can be quality overview of what kind of quality we wanted to deliver to a client. Or to a customer. So these are the things have been covered into that particular topic. So with the help of the this particular prints to certification I am able to understand how to design a particular project plan in terms of how I would actually apply it on my exact project what I would say in my daily basis on my work role as by so I have already earlier applied these kind of techniques and practices in my previous organization. I can give an example. So agile is also one of the important aspect of any project where so we can get the product a project output on a on a iterative manner. So how I have used Ajay, which is also taught in to a prince to project. So in particularly agile how I used to do it. First of all, let's say I wanted to deliver in one project which is a project longitude where I work. So what I used to do.Created in my in in delivering this particular new landing page. So first of all, let's take three weeks of timeline to deliver this dedicated landing page. Now. Let's say the one week will be dedicated for all the research how the page will look like how the tiles will look like how long will be the page will be which brands will be positioned at what position on the landing page how the what will be the size Which which kind of banners will be put onto the landing page which category specifically into the launcher. That's a bra and be which categories we need to show up. Is there any Brands which are ready to put money for monetization on our landing page? So all these aspects we need to first of all understand and then apply agile onto that and meanwhile for that we are also need to ensure that there should be clear communication among all the stakeholders. What is the update is going on. We need to report it to the top management also about my project progress about the kpis. What was success metrics we have and what will be our next step. So in that way understanding my understanding the agile concept and applying certain principles of Prince 2 or principal's processes teams and all these aspects. I tried to apply it and in that way I usually work as a project manager.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a comprehensive explanation, thank you. It's clear you have a strong grasp on the Prince2 principles and how to integrate them with Agile methodologies. Shifting focus to your technical skills, you mentioned proficiency in Tableau and Google Analytics. Could you describe a complex data analysis you've performed using these tools and how it impacted decision-making in one of your projects? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah, for sure John. So let me start with the Google analytics first. So what exactly we used to do in Google analytics as I walked with a jio, which is a e-commerce website and in any e-commerce platform, it is very important that you need to understand the customer Behavior how he or she is coming and how he or she is exiting and in that what exactly they are doing. So Google analytics is basically at that point of time is helping me out in order to understand. How to do this customer Behavior which is giving me a complete clarity about the demographics. Let me talk about let's say age their gender maybe from which location they are coming from then from which site not sight, but from which operating system they are using from which mobile device they are using so all these aspects are used to understand Kitty. I do have a lot of Android users or I do have a lot of iOS users and then how I can optimize these operating systems also for my app. This is one thing also how many users are coming on my platform by Facebook or Instagram or any Social Media Camping we are doing or how many customers are coming from email or Whatsapp Campaign, which we are doing so that is one basic understanding. I was getting second about the customer Behavior which are talking about it's about let's 100 users came onto the app now which is a PLP page. So there are three to four terminologies which we are using when is PLP which is product listing page PDP is product description page. Then ATC is add to card and Ty is thank you screen. So how we use to understand over here. So PLP PLP, let's say 100 users are coming. Now after that once customer is coming on to PLP, maybe customer only 50 customers are clicking on an on any Banner then they are going into PDP then after that. Let's say on a 20 customers are doing that product at two car and only five customers are purchasing it. So this is well. Once this is my funnel in order to understand how many people are coming and how many are buying then this at the end? I will understand. Okay. This is the conversion the conversion definition is thank you screen divided by actor. This is one metric which we used to see from Google Analytics. Also from here, I would be able to understand from where exactly my customers are dropping is it like let's say customers are handed users are coming on product landing page, but they are not going into PDP very few conversion is happening from PDP to PLP. So what exactly the problem is there, we can jotted down we can figure it out maybe the customers which brought may be the customers maybe the products which customers are looking for is not available. That may be one reason may be the Image was not great. Maybe customers are looking for a size some other kind of a filters also onto the PLP some illu creative content. Also, there may be they were looking for maybe they were looking for embedded filters. Let's say when they are scrolling if they wanted to filter over their only keyless. I wanted to see only l size t-shirt of Adidas brand specifically if customers are coming. They are not getting those aspects and they need to explore a lot that platform. So how we can ease their Journey all those aspects you can think of in any direction that is one aspect. So similarly for the next step if you are going maybe customers are clicking on product description page, but they are not going into they are not doing it putting it into active card. So what can we do that reason? So these kind of reasons we have jotted down with right to understand the complete customer Behavior with the help of Google analytics in Google analytics. There are so many different Search terms are available. The different terminologies they use like how you can also try to understand from over there. He what exactly customers are searching when you when whenever any customer is coming on Google what they are looking for or on my website itself what exactly they are searching on my platform, so that is all so that we used to get it. So there are like Impressions clicks conversion as I told you PLP PDP number of sessions number of new users number of existing users. So all these data we used to get it from Google analytics now I wanted to talk about like in this way I used to do I use Google analytics in my data.How I used a tableau in my previous organization, is it acts like a data repository for Reliance jio where data of mostly of every kind was stored over there for a G only it will not give me the entire knowledge about how exactly my customers are performing. In a customer's are performing. Into the how I would say into the website, I will only get the data about how much revenue what is the traffic. I'm getting a number of sessions which I am getting if we have done any. CRM campaign, what was the conversion through that? Then I used to get a data about subcategory category level. Let's say a brand level data. Let's say any which particular Brands performing very good in terms of Revenue, which particular category is performing which particular subcategory is performing very good in terms of Revenue. So in that way, I used Tablo so there it's not a very exhaustive Tableau. I would say like there are different different kind of maps and representations you can use but I have used to very basic one in terms of just pulling out the data understanding the data and then analyzing it and analyzing it and make a decision. On on top of that. So in that way I have used w.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for the detailed explanation of how you've utilized Google Analytics and Tableau to drive data-driven decisions. It's clear you have a strong analytical background. Now, considering your experience in project management and your role at FirstCry, how do you approach stakeholder management, especially when there are conflicting interests or priorities among stakeholders? \\n\", \"Interviewee: All right, so John. Stakeholder management, I personally feel is a very challenging task and for that. You also need one kind of. Good repo with the people with whom you are working. So first of all as a project manager, it's very important to listen. Everyone's Point. First of all to understand why they are saying that and from where they are coming from because if you talk about if you talk to any technical person or a team manager of any technical team, he's or her terminal lodges and challenges are different then a person who is coming from a business team. So first of all, we need to understand both of their point of view. Understanding each everyone's challenges in order to deliver the project or a product. and according to that need to create a middle ground so that everybody is able to do their job on time and be productive. I can give one example also on that so why let's say again on I can give an example of RG or itself about the stakeholder management. So while I was working there there was a big conflict among sales in planning team and content and creative team. Uh, we have created a new landing page for one personalization project. So now sales and planning team needs to give their input in terms of what brands will be getting visibility in the next week or the next month. What kind of offers we will put it on that. Let's say Eddie does 50% off or a 60% off. These kind of inputs needs to come from sales and planning team. If I talk about content and creative this theme will be helping us out to create the new landing page in terms of content in terms of its images in terms of how the page will look like the complete front end part. Now the the sales and planning team is very much resistant. They were saying that we can't give you input. In one week and sales and continent continent and creative team told that no, we want the input. We want these kind of inputs from you within the within one week so that we would be able to deliver. My deliver the complete new landing page on time. So this was a dispute and this was going on. So I had to call with the head of departments from both the department like one is from sales planning and creative and the people also who will be helping me to execute it. Ah, because the as a what I have also realized it's very important to listen the point of view from the people who are executing it because they also do have their own challenges. So understanding them understanding their timeline.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. I can. Great.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! With your extensive experience in the Aerospace, Power, and Oil & Gas industries, could you share an example of a new business setup for NPI/NPD industrialization that you led, and how you approached the challenges that came with it? \\n', 'Interviewee: In aerospace It seems there might have been a miss\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It seems there might have been a misunderstanding. I'm looking for a detailed response to the question about your experience with new business setups for NPI/NPD industrialization. Could you please elaborate on a specific project, the challenges you faced, and the strategies you used to overcome them? \\n\", \"Interviewee: So NPI and NPD projects related, uh, news startups related projects, I'll going to explain here. So in aerospace, first, I take it as a aerospace, then I'm moving to uh, power industry. So in aerospace, for, uh, PWC, pattern with the Canada, I have taken a project. It's a, uh, a manufacturing project. So I have to set up a new facility for manufacturing. It includes, uh, getting a budget approval, then, uh, setting a new facility and, uh, implementing a new machine on for that, then, uh, train the people towards that NPA and NPT, then, uh, bring into package and make it uh, prove the component into the, uh, n NPI. And once it's done, then it's handover to the production team. So such a way, the aerospace industry in PMI engineering export, uh, Private Limited. This project is carried out for PWC Canada. So this has given a lot of experience for me to hiring, uh, new team, hiring a new machines for the specific, uh, project, and train them and coach them and deploy the line of, uh, NPA production. So each and every corner, I have to manage the budget according to the stepwise and the stage wise, uh, to monitor the timeline. If it's goes something, uh, out of timeline, then getting a permission from, uh, actual, uh, management requesting, and they get the additional timeline. And, uh, and with the justification, I get the timeline, then we can proceed further. And deliberately working towards the deadline to the project on, yeah, on any of the, uh, NPI and NPD products. So this is from Aerospace. And coming back to, uh, power, power NPI is nothing but, um, the steam turbine, newly, uh, new factory project it is. It starts from, uh, greenfield projects, and it's, uh, it this is also it's, uh, again, starts from creating a specification for the requirement to the, uh, digital fact. Again, this, uh, digital factory requirement and, uh, it's involved IO IIoT, networking, and IT infrastructure for digital manufacturing and especially integrating all the, uh, NPA manufacturing machines, uh, materials, even, uh, deploy, uh, engineering teams and integrating with the r and d engineering and the manufacturing and cross functionals like finance, uh, HR, supply chain, admin. Because this is a project is a whole lot of things involved since it's a newly built uh, factory project. So I have taken initially, I have taken as a IT, uh, role since, uh, my role as a CAT CAM project manager role, it's come in between. So during that period, I take an IT infrastructure and creating the entire IT infra for the, uh, IT, uh, sorry, factory project. And during that time, I have taken as, uh, my second responsibility that, uh, integration CAT cam integration as a part. And that I'll consider in during IT. And according to that, the steps were followed and the, um, the facility is created. So this is 1. And, uh, and, uh, during that time, I supposed to, um, handle the 2 type of budget because one is IT infrastructure budget, and second one is, uh, I'd uh, I IT and IS project budget. So both the way, it will be a a timeline based because this project is delayed by one of the fear, uh, from the earlier place to new place. So, uh, the timeline has freeze like anything. So according to that, we have, uh, focusedly worked to deliver the NPA product to the customer that is, uh, government of India. And they have given minimum of 18 months to build and, uh, give the, uh, first part out, first NPA to get approval from customer that we have done greatly with, uh, all the, uh, cross functional supports with, uh, our experts. Uh, this is, uh, enormous output and the timely deliver we have given. So based out of it, uh, by 2,016, my entire project team, including the, uh, technical support team under me, have taken a a g award for, uh, deliver, uh, as prior as expected, uh, such a title it is. It was, uh, really appreciated that that we have achieved that project within the timeline. Hope these two project as a NPA and the NPD are done. And name my last role, uh, the another project that's called product development. That is, again, purely the NPA product. That product, they call the drill bit. In the drill bit, that is, uh, this is a oil and gas, uh, project. In that drill bit, it was earlier semi automated, uh, functionally, the operations and the functions are captured. But, uh, the prior NPA is given for me and my team is it need to be automated. The entire, uh, drill bit operation function need to be captured. So there's a lot of, uh, brainstorm has taken and, uh, a lot of study have taken from various oil and gas field, uh, datas. With that, we have modified the sensors and the gyro sensors and turn on bit, wait on bit. Those things were consider, and it will be implemented into the circuit form and designed. And those things, again, uh, it's a new first time we have implemented and first time we have developed the product in India, um, uh, with the, uh, localization under the heading of an organization. So earlier, this project and the product is developed in US. Combantly, US and India, almost 65%. We have reduced the, uh, new development cost with this localization heading. And this is another achievement, based out of this 2020 sorry. 2019, me and my team has got the award that, uh, we, uh, across the boundary, we across the boundary, we are sure the deli verse. So such a title, we got it another g award. So such a way, uh, all the 3 in fact, the 3 companies I have worked and all the 3 companies, I have one another way. I have achieved, uh, the, uh, project expectation, and I make it a profit to the uh, business as expected. Based out of it, the awards shows how I performed and how I got that awards. Hope this is enough on the project of NPA and NPD in the new setups. Do you have any other, uh, points to discuss? Uh, shall we go on to the next\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Thank you for that comprehensive overview of your experience with NPI/NPD projects across different industries. It's clear that you have a strong track record of delivering complex projects on time and under budget. Given your background in digital manufacturing and IT, could you discuss how you've integrated digital transformation initiatives within these projects, and perhaps share an example of how you leveraged technology to improve efficiency or outcomes? \\n\", \"Interviewee: Uh, here I have to take it that, uh, project delivery sorry. Uh, project delivery of factory. So this factory, uh, the, uh, notation is given for me is, uh, uh, digital manufacturing. So digital manufacturing is a notation for me as a, uh, project manager. So as I told in the NPA in the last question, the from the starting, the entire factory is build considering and keeping in the mind that the digital manufacturing and the each and every equipment, it will be coming and bringing to IoT networks. So based out of it, the entire equipments, uh, equipments in the sense, I can say about, uh, production machine, product, uh, even start from cutting machine, then production machine, then measuring machines, CMM, even for the Vernier Calipers and other equipment, uh, screw, uh, uh, screw micrometers and whatever is a small measuring equipments. Everything it's bringing to the digitalization mode. So even though if we did the manual equipment, we'll in we'll introduce a sensor on it. And based out of the sensors and, uh, based of the sensor, the data, whatever we are measuring on the equipment, even in the machine, even in the, uh, production mesh, and every datas, it'll be collected via, um, Wi Fi, sometime Wi Fi, sometime USB, uh, through USB cable, the machines and the instruments connected to the network, IoT network. Through the IoT network, the data will be going to store in the database. In the database from the database, the data, it'll be bringing bridge to SAP, where, uh, we have developed, uh, our routers and, uh, process cards and process monitoring and quality check, all those things. So all the datas, whatever functionally captured, those things will be stored in database. From the database, it's pushed to the, uh, SAP related to the operation, related to the function, related to the setups. So this is one setup, front end setup in intermediate setup. And back end setup, again, uh, we have, uh, in, uh, GE, we have used that, um, predicts platform. This is a dedicated platform like AWS, Amazon, um, AWS. This predicts platform. Again, it's give the leverage to take the datas. Whatever the datas we stored in the SAP, those, uh, datas can be pulled to the, um, predicts platform, and the predicts platform will generate, uh, applications, uh, which shows the performance of each and every equipment, every, uh, machine's performance. Those datas will be collected, and it will be designed into the software, uh, display. Display. Those displays, it will be again, uh, it will be showcased in front of each machines and each equipments. On collective report, it will be showcased into a, uh, plan manager and production manager as well as MD. And where who are it need to be monitored the performance of man, material, and machineries is everything it's collected and integrated. And those integration, it'll be displayed as a, uh, UAA screen into the, uh, required, uh, managers and decision, uh, take it can view this with their logins. So with that performance, if it goes down now as per the schedule, then immediate pop up, it'll be raised via first, it will rise via email to supervisor, then it will be send it to manager, and next, it will go into plan manager. If nothing has happened, then it'll move on to the MD. So such a way, the entire factory, it will be integrated in terms of technical system and the physical equipments. And those the equipments, datas will be collected in and stored into, uh, database and database from the database, uh, the push will happen to SAP from the SAP. Again, as a, um, uh, predicts platform, we collect all the datas and develop the UIA and display to entire, uh, management of the performance. So this is this way, uh, with the, uh, digitalization is happened, uh, on each and every equipments. So, um, uh, this is all the conventional machine. I mean to say, even if it is CNC machines, it will perform its, uh, indigenous. But, uh, once coming to the factory and bringing to the IIoT network platform, then it will be integrated and make it as a digitalization to collect the required information. Such a way the entire equipment is done and made it into the production, uh, up and running. So once this is done and, uh, over the 2016, by the time the project is done, the digital manufacturing, by the time I was asked to do it, the entire factory as a smart factory. So the in the factory, there is a activity. The main activity is called, uh, manufacturing. So the initial step is manufacturing related activity, cross functionals, and all these interlinking functions have made it at a digital manufacturing platform. Then now it's asked for the, uh, smart factory. The smart factory is nothing but the entire factory activity apart from, uh, manufacturing. Uh, there is a a supply chain. There is a finance. There will be a admin. There will be a, um, HR. So such a way, all the cross functionals teams has to bring into the digitalization. So how it is, again, this performance, all it will be stored into the SAP, And this SAP data's again, each and every cross functionals will make it a segregation, these datas, and send it to according to their functions, what are the data is required, and we'll send to them. So this is one part of segregation data segregation be done, and they give it to, uh, rec record functions. And there, we'll make it a small UOE according to their functions and their performance and their output, how it will perform. Such a way, we will create the cross functional, uh, UAEs and, um, such a way, the cross functions are coming under the digital manufacturing and smart factory. Again, apart from this cross functional, there is a physical and inventory management and security management and the attendance management. Those things are coming under the Smart Factory. The Smart Factory is nothing but again, whenever any good person or, uh, message is coming via gate, From that point, it start that digitalization. Uh, then it will convert, and it will be converted as a value added services to the material man or whatever else. Once it's going out of another exit gate, by the time the all the records have starts from gate in entry gate to exit gate, everything, it will be monitored and controlled and, uh, make it, uh, data driven, uh, data driven point of each activity. And such a way, I made it entire factory into a smart factory. So that mean so nothing can't escape as a manual operation or manual function. So entire things, it will be tracked and captured in, uh, in the digital form, and the entire factory is converted now in 2018. It's everything is converted into the smart factory. So by the time I have completed this digitalization and smart factory activities, So this was good. Do you have any, uh, points related to, uh, digitalization and smart factory? If it's so, we can proceed. Otherwise, we'll jump into the next question. Thanks for taking the time to\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: '], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's dive into your resume. I see you've had significant experience in social media and content strategy. Can you elaborate on a specific strategy you implemented at HongKong Yinta Tech that led to the 70% increase in brand awareness? What were the key components of this strategy and how did you measure its success?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, definitely, John. So first of all, I have around 6 years of experience in social media, and I have worked with major international companies like Garena, Hong Kong Intertek, ByteDance, and. In my last 6 years of experience, I have worked been working extensively in social media strategy, social media campaigns, influencer marketing, and all of branding with the company. So at Homegrown Intertech, I have increased in 70% of the revenue and overall visibility of the brand. So, uh, before that, I have, uh, led a team of 20 influencer marketing strategies in India and a strategy for promoting our furniture products to Instagram. So, uh, I have, um, made the complete SOP for working Amazon campaigns as well as influencer marketing campaigns. Uh, I led the team members and helped them in reaching out to the influencers through generated text, and as well as we have used AI and JetGPT in finding out, uh, the best influencers in furniture category. As our company, we majorly work on furniture and auto parts. We have, uh, reached out for the niche, uh, auto parts and furniture influencers, and this is how, uh, we have made this strategy. And apart from that, I have worked with my team, uh, especially with the Amazon teams from Shanghai, work with them in implementing Amazon campaigns for our brand, for branding and overall, uh, the value generation as well as, uh, increasing the overall visibility of Amazon page. So this is how, uh, I have helped the company in getting more revenue and helping them in, uh, getting, uh, more visibility and make them a strong brand among their competitors. Thank you.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: That's quite impressive. Given your experience with influencer marketing and AI tools for influencer selection, could you detail the criteria used to identify the most effective influencers for your campaigns? How did you measure the effectiveness of these criteria, and were there any adjustments made based on the campaign's performance?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Definitely. So in our, uh, company, we use this, uh, international marketing tool called High Colliter. So using this tool, we check the whole engagement, estimated cost, and our collaboration time with the influencer. And based on that, we reached out to the influencers based on the engagement, their niche category, their followers, their audience, whether they are based in New Year or they are based in Europe. So we check all these things using this AI tool. And apart from that, we use their GPD, uh, for campaign drafting, for templates, for hashtags, as well as the descriptions which we send to the influencers. And this thing has actually helped us in getting more, uh, traction and made our work more easy and as well as increase our productivity. So this is how, uh, we, uh, have these are the techniques that we use for influencer marketing. And in influencer marketing, uh, like, I have around 6 years of experience in managing agencies as well. So we are collaborating with agencies as well for influencer, store promotion, and, uh, we also hire influencers through agencies as well. And regarding the negotiations, uh, we have the strategy. We, uh, look out to the influencer profile. Suppose that influencer is, uh, doing so much of home decor items. He is into funny second degree. So we look at the home and look at their, like, spaces and what kind of things. She she has an outdoor garden. So we will recommend her items ready to go out for garden, which she actually needs. So in that way, we, uh, have achieved significant bottle collaboration as well. We have the barter collaborations with, uh, in cancer called Kamna Hospital, and she's one of the top that, you know, transfer in US in DIY category. And we, uh, I looked at her, uh, like, backyard. She needed a fire table. She doesn't have a fire table at the time. So we shipped the fire table to her. And, uh, I had a negotiation with her. We had a call, and then I discussed that this this is the thing that we are, you know, planning to ship and how this thing will help her audience in being more engaged, and this is something she and her audience both will love. So she agreed to the barter collaboration. Uh, so this is how we reach out to influencers, check their needs, and, uh, we want them to closely we work with them closely and, uh, hold some strategy for beneficial for mutual beneficial of influencer as well as our brand. Apart from that, we are very cordial, and we always, uh, reply to the influencers for time and take care, uh, about their needs, and we'll make sure that the influencers will be posting, uh, the pending post on time as well. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your approach to influencer selection and engagement strategy is quite comprehensive. Regarding the AI tool Hypetrack, how do you ensure the data accuracy and reliability of the engagement metrics provided by the tool, especially given that influencer engagement metrics can sometimes be inflated or manipulated?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so first of all, we checked, uh, the inferencing data and the engagement to high quality. So apart from that, we have our own CPM calculation method. In CPM, we prefer the greatest with a CPM of less than 15. CPM is like, uh, like, you know, the cost per 1,000, uh, views. The cost in USD per 1,000 views. So make sure that, uh, the CPA would influence us less than 15. And apart from that, we also check, uh, the engagement manually. So What we do is that we go to the Instructure profile and check out the top 5 videos, like, recent 5 videos, and check out the total engagement and total reach. Uh, like, suppose it has, uh, total, uh, you know, view of 1 lakh in the last 5 videos. And the average will be 20,000 for 1 video. And based on that, we will be calculating the CPM. And apart from that, we'll be checking if the influencer recently had a viral post or something. And suppose she had raised her recent temp post had 1,000,000. So based on that, we see the annual impression that we would reach. And apart from that, we check the comments as well because comments should be, uh, like, general if the, you know, the comments user the commenting user are actual or more. So we check that manually as well as ping then make sure that the inferencing we are collaborating with must be of high quality so that we can achieve our highest ROI as well as, uh, our CPM would be the least. Thank you.\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It's clear you have a robust system for vetting influencers. Shifting focus to your data analysis skills, could you describe a scenario where you used data analysis to optimize a marketing campaign? What specific metrics did you focus on, and how did the insights from the data analysis drive your decision-making process?  \\n\", 'Interviewee: Yes. Definitely, John. So I as I mentioned, I led an Agile campaign to eat a home. So in that campaign, uh, there were around 50 products, and I was, uh, designing the landing page of the campaign, uh, with our product and design team. So I observed data on the sales data, uh, through data and analysis, this is I observed that there are 5 essence of the actual which I have the highest sales. And it was very evident that those XDRs are very competitive, and these are one of our best selling products. So the core of the campaign was generating the highest revenue. I have collaborated with the Amazon team and checked the item was abundant in store. So we, uh, on the front page, we made sure that through data analysis, we added most 5 x shares on the top of the campaign as the main highlight because this is the product that is currently worth selling. And we want to increase the visibility of 1 product because if we have a one very highly popular product, then brand awareness will increase as well. Also, our customer will see if the quality of brand is good, and then, uh, they will, uh, shift to the, uh, checking out or figuring out some new products for them as well. So we, uh, added those 2, 5 tables, uh, in the 2, 5 chairs in the campaign, uh, in the front page. And after that, uh, we added those new ASMs which we want to promote because, uh, it was, like, the Black Friday sale and the year was almost approaching. It was ending. So we added the our latest arrivals for 2024, the next year, uh, below those 2, 5 trending products so that we also promoted our best products, upcoming best products through, uh, the campaign. So the campaign had a very great sale. We had achieved 100 k USD plus sales in just a week, uh, for the ad sales. And it was a massive success for the team, and it was really, like, uh, a big massive success, uh, during the Black Friday sale for the company. Thank you.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Given the significant impact of your data-driven campaign on Amazon, could you elaborate on the process of selecting the initial five products for the campaign? How did your data analysis approach differentiate between high competition products and those with high potential for visibility and sales growth?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. I as I already mentioned, for, uh, the top five products, we have, uh, checked the sales data. And due to, uh, after data analysis, we added the top five best selling products on the sheet because the major most of the campaigns were increasing the sales, uh, during, uh, that quarter. So, uh, uh, we made around 100 k USD of sales, and around 70% of the sales were to the the top 5 x shares that were already wholesaling items, and 20% were the new items, uh, sales to generated for the new items that we were planning to promote in 20 24. There those are our latest arrivals. So by mixing those trending products and latest arrivals, we we will be very sure that, uh, there will be high visibility for those products. And also, we have promoted the new products to Android app during the same time. So that apart from these trending products, we can have some new trending products as well. And this campaign did really well our new items. We also would put you some of the sales for the new items as well, which we have just recently launched at the time. This is how we have, uh, increased the overall, uh, revenue as well as, uh, promoting the new products for our company, uh, through Amazon Champions. Thank you.\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to balancing the promotion of established best-sellers with new arrivals is strategic. In terms of the new products introduced during the campaign, how did you define and measure their success? What metrics or benchmarks were used to evaluate whether a new product's introduction was considered successful, and did this feedback loop influence your future product selection for campaigns?  \\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. So our major goal was we want to sell at least 200 of those x s on of the new arrivals, uh, on our Amazon campaign. So during that time, uh, we had a sales of 20,000 USD, and we have, uh, scored around, uh, 1, uh, 1 50 of those HCS new HCS. So, see, the goal was, like, really on a higher side because for a new product getting 1, uh, 200 of sales is sometimes a bit challenging. But, uh, the management and team members, they were very, uh, uh, happy with the seeing the growth and because we did it through one campaign only. We didn't promote the ad sales, uh, you know, through some other methods through, uh, you know, some I'm gonna add as well. So that's why they, uh, were very happy with the performance. And later in the campaign after 1st week, we started promoting those new products to Amazonas as well. And we have seen a tremendous growth in the sales volume of the new products, and new product alone was considered successful at the time. This is our approach. And, uh, the metrics that we use for, um, the, uh, you know, for the improvement of, uh, our sales as well as the considering the success of our new launches is that this should be, uh, a decent clicks as well as because we want to make check the product pictures as well. If, you know, if their customer are coming to the landing page, it means that, uh, that they're clear on the product picture. It means that the pictures are already good. And because it's a new product, there were no not many reviews. So we have made sure the description is, like, really crisp, and we have highlighted the means from points of the chairs in the first, uh, you know, first paragraphs of the, um, description of the Amazon Edge chairs. So this is how, uh, we, uh, you know, promoted the chair. And for the success of the campaign, the goal was around 200 and at least 2,000 clicks and 200 of sales. Uh, this was the goal, and we have achieved around 5,000 clicks and around 150, uh, tiers in the selling volume. So that's, uh, how we have managed the campaign, and this is how we have described the success of the campaign for the new launches. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The focus on both sales volume and engagement metrics, such as clicks and landing page interactions, is insightful. How do you approach the challenge of establishing trust and credibility for new products, especially in the absence of many reviews, and how does this factor into your marketing and communication strategies for new product launches?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. For new products, our major goal is to promote them with the older products that are doing already well. And apart from that, we use Amazon ads as well, and we will influence the marketing majorly. We send these new products. We've given before launch. Suppose if the product is about to launch in March, so we will start shipping the product in January to the influencer and our vendor will post by February, February ending. Suppose if the, uh, loans date is, uh, March 1, then we will make sure the post are done by March 30. So if, uh, March February 28, this is our timeline. And then Spencer will tell to the their audience that, you know, this is a new product. I have received the limited edition, this new product from. And this is the newest HCL, and I found it really cool to make sure that our product is best in class and the inferences we see too are relevant, uh, for the product. And we before announcing the product, we make good, uh, content available even on the, uh, influencers side, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube as well. And also, we, uh, also have connection with the blog post as well, which we will write out about the new launches of our product, about our company. So we'll also promote those products on our those schedule as well. And apart from that, from the new products, we also use deal groups. There are so many deal groups we are in touch with. And also, there are so many deal websites in the US, flex details we use on them. We have partners with them, and we ship out we promote our new products, uh, on their website as well. And we provide special discount codes, uh, for our new launches and coupons so that customers can check those products initially. And, uh, you know, we can promote our products. And for the like, reviewing the note, uh, we send our product to influencers so that they can test the products. And if they really like the, you know, the product, then they will, you know, tell good things about the products on their platforms and people will be genuinely buying the products. And so this is the initial phase. Once we make sure the quality of products is really good, in the later phases, uh, the customer reviews come out to be posted because we make sure that the customer experience is our priority and the products will see follow the best quality to the to customers as well as to the influencer. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your comprehensive approach to launching new products, encompassing influencer engagement, content marketing, and strategic partnerships for reviews and promotions, is quite detailed. How do you plan to scale these initiatives for new product launches, especially considering the need to maintain high-quality and authentic engagement as volumes increase?  \\n', \"Interviewee: So yeah. Also, in that scenario, uh, we make sure that the quality of the products we are seeing in the influences are too close. And quality of the reviews are maintained, uh, by because we make sure that the customer reviews are genuine. So if there is some issues that our users are facing, so we contact those, ask them to share their, uh, numbers, their customer support as well, and we try to reach out to the customers and ask them, like, what are the issues they are facing. If they are facing some, you know, real issues, the product has arrived damaged, broken, and that's why they put a bad review on the MRO. So we asked them to, uh, we'll ask them for an replacement. We send the best product in replacement and make sure that other customer experience will not, uh, suffer. And after the, uh, right product has been signed, we are comfortable. Uh, if they are willing to change the review, they can change the review because we customer satisfaction are priority. And for scaling those campaigns, initially, we use in customer marketing, Amazon ads, and also our blog post and our deal website for promoting our products. We have like occasional campaigns, monthly campaigns on Amazon for our new arrivals. Like summer campaign, autumn campaign, uh, like season wise we have multiple campaigns and also we promote our product doing Black Friday sales as well. So this is our strategy for promoting the new products and scaling the campaigns for both products. Thank you.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Your emphasis on customer feedback and the proactive approach to addressing issues to enhance the overall customer experience and product quality is commendable. How do you envision leveraging technology, such as AI and data analytics, to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes, particularly in the realm of influencer management and customer engagement?  \\n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so our support team, they are using the AI based, uh, chat chat support. So, you know, we are implementing those AI tools in our chat support as well so that we can increase the efficiency, and one person can handle 2, 3, uh, queries with chat support in one time. You need to handle the AI. We are using AI for, uh, reverting to our customers. And apart from that, we are using AI for, uh, checking out the trends in the market. Also, checking out, uh, you know, everything related to the marketing domain, what are our competitors are doing, what kind of products they are working really well in the market. So this is how we are leveraging AI and data analysis in promoting our products and helping the company grow. Thank you.\\n'], ['Interviewer: Integrating AI into your customer support processes and market research initiatives is a strategic move. How do you ensure that the AI tools used for trend analysis and competitor research provide accurate and actionable insights, and what metrics do you use to measure the effectiveness of these AI applications in your decision-making processes?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. We do not rely on this one AI software. We get data from multiple AI sources. Uh, and apart from that, we have our own Amazon data as well. So we try to do the data analysis by keep making a report, keeping all the AI data as well as our internal Amazon data and our campaign data. So combining both these 3, uh, functional, uh, information, we make a strategy based on that, and based on that, we make the decision. We don't make this decision based on this one report. We figure out, uh, multiple reports and figure out what is right thing, uh, to do for our company, what is the brand most, and based on that, we create strategies using the AI tools as well as our internal data.\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Diversifying your data sources for strategic decision-making, including both AI-driven insights and internal campaign data, is a robust approach. How do you see the role of AI evolving in the field of influencer marketing and content strategy, and what are some potential areas where you believe AI could have a significant impact on your current practices?  \\n', \"Interviewee: Yes. No. AI has been evolving, like, really to a next level because there are already some softwares in that market for influencer marketing, which are AI based and which will help you in helping the influencer or getting influencer for the brand. So there are some AI tools which will, uh, if you go to the tools, and they will send automated emails about your interest to them. They will send automated, uh, Instagram messages to an AI, uh, using your the AI tool. So, uh, AI has been, uh, it has a, like, really big score in terms of marketing and campaigns, and it has been already seen through automatic AI generated newsletters. We are has been a tool for insider club, which helps influencers, uh, in, uh, connecting with their audience. Both I'm an influencer, and I have around 100 k followers. And, you know, I can have a separate community moving to AI tool. And every time I post a video, my all my followers who have subscribed to me, they will get a newsletter that, hi. This is, uh, influencer and she won't be as posted a video recently. You can click on the link below, and you can you can see, uh, the video using the link below. So this will help the influencer getting more leads and, you know, staying connected better with the audience. And if necessary, he doesn't have to do much. He just because the older message, everything will be generated. And below the, uh, agent, it will be some promotions as well as coupon codes and everything which can be used by its followers. And you know, also, uh, the followers, they can use the coupon code and do shopping. And if they're doing shopping, and the influencer, because they're using the influencer's link, we will be getting some additional remaining as well, uh, through AI, and it will be all tracked automatically by AI. He must have doesn't have to, uh, you know, do much or, uh, mandate his own links or something. It will be done by AI only. And it there'll be a dashboard in which influencer can see monthly income as well. So this is how AI has been changing the overall influencer marketing landscape. For influencer, it is helping influencer engineering more than we were saying, uh, more, uh, closely with their audiences, staying better in touch with them, and also generating more revenue as well as getting more reach. And for the companies, AI is helping, uh, gather companies, reaching the influencers, uh, by through and telling about the brands. And, uh, also, uh, AI will be, you know, minimizing the workload of the influencer marketing managers in the coming weeks as well. So this is how I believe AI is, uh, changing, uh, influencer marketing space. And using the AI, you can even do trends analysis. You can check what is the latest trends on multiple websites. And AI can even design a complete influencer marketing campaign for you. If you search about, uh, like, what kind of campaigns are currently in trend, and the AI will help you with that in figuring out the right campaign for your brand. You can even ask AI, this is my into this space, and we want to, uh, be the best in that space. And also, we want to, uh, design a campaign for our best part of the product. So can we select some campaigns? Here, we come up with, uh, one of, uh, the good ideas for the campaigns and later you can change the campaign according to what you need, but it will help you in brainstorming as well.

            "### Candidate B has done this interview and their academic profile with resume : Candidate B Transcript: {'pairs': [['Interviewer: Hello and welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\n', 'Interviewee: You? Yes. I am. Thank you.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at Rampiva Legal. You mentioned signing the company's first vendor channel partner. Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced in establishing this partnership and how you overcame them?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, a channel partner, as you probably know, is the partner that's gonna sell your product for you. And, uh, in this particular instance, uh, there was a a company that was consulting with other law firms and other companies, mostly other companies in the in the construction field. And, uh, they processed with the same processing engine, which is Nuix. And, uh, I knew some people there. So I was able to take my personal relationship with them as, uh, as an in, if you will, you know, establishing some trust based on our our prior relationship, our prior performance. And, uh, uh, yeah, I was able to start talking to them. And after, uh, they agreed to take a look at the product, vet it, uh, the the product spoke for itself. It's a good product, and they were happy with it. So it it overcame that kind of initial resistance of, um, offering something they hadn't offered before.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: That's a significant achievement. When it came to vetting the product, how did you address any concerns the partner may have had about integrating Rampiva's solution with their existing workflow, especially considering the unique needs of the construction industry?  \\n\\n\", 'Interviewee: Well, more properly, the unique workflow is the Nuix processing engine. Nuix is an engine that processes data in the discovery. It then goes into a hosting review platform and a number of AI and and tar tools as well.\\n\\n'], [\"Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a thoughtful approach to addressing these concerns. Can you elaborate on the technical aspects of integrating Rampiva's solution with the partner's existing workflow, particularly how you communicated this to the partner to build trust in the solution's compatibility?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. And I I guess to preface that by saying, I'm not the the technical, uh, consultant on that. I understand the technology, but, uh, you know, at that fine level, we have, uh, uh, subject matter experts. But the key thing here is that, uh, when Nuix processes, it's a very powerful tool, but it's a very cludgy tool. It's very difficult and very high maintenance. So when it came to integrating with their workflow, what we're able to show them is you have this very complicated workflow, uh, uh, in order to take advantage of all the, uh, the firepower, all the technology that you have in in processing. And by using the Rampiva, you're gonna get more out of it easier. So, uh, it's easier for staffing, uh, it's easier in terms of budgeting. And, you know, the key the key thing that grease the wheel, if you will, is that, uh, it allowed them to make far more efficient and economic use of something they already had.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the high-level technical aspects is definitely crucial for effective sales. Shifting focus a bit, in your role at Ryley Carlock & Applewhite, you led a team of approximately 8 members in eDiscovery and Managed Review. Can you discuss a specific challenge you faced in leading this team and how you addressed it?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Sure. Um, I think the biggest problem that team had was their value proposition, if you will. That's what makes what they were doing better than what other people doing the same thing were. So for example, their their value\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding and differentiating the value proposition is key. How did you work with your team to clearly define and communicate this value proposition to both internal stakeholders and clients, ensuring everyone was aligned on the unique selling points of your services?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think internally, uh, they understood it, uh, instinctively, but they didn't really, uh, were able to, you know, render it into something that was easily described. The the value statement for Riley Kerlock's managed review is that it was a law firm quality review, uh, at a discount price. There's different levels of review in the managed review business. You can get, you know, quick, cheap, and dirty overseas. You can get highly technical for things like IP and patent that is very expensive. So they were kind of, um, that law firm level review. That's a good level of review, a sophisticated level review, but kind of at a bargain price. So one of the problems they were having is they were, uh, competing for projects that didn't align with where their value proposition was. Some of them were either too technical or some of them were either, uh, uh, too cheap. They didn't need the value that we had, so they didn't need to pay for it. So the thing to get them working properly was to align, uh, the targets, align the the targets potential customers with the offering that we had. And the way that is done is by, uh, coming up with a marketing plan that targets the right kind of client. The client who, if they were in a position to say yes, it would make sense for them to do so. And that that kind of uncorked the dam and allowed them to start expanding.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Aligning the target market with your value proposition is crucial for business growth. Can you detail the specific components of the marketing plan that helped realign your target clients and expand your business in the right direction?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: No. I think I I think I have to a degree, but I can I can kind of reencapsulate them if you will? Uh, we were looking for clients that needed attorney level review. And, you know, review doesn't have to be done by attorneys. It can also be done by very sophisticated subject matter experts. So we were looking for certain types of review. Usually, a construction, as I've cited, is is 1, general business litigation, you know, things like this. By identifying the, uh, where our values showed up the best, we were able to go and look at practice groups and law firms and go, okay. They do the kind of work that is the kind of work that we're looking for. So by talking to them, we can discuss projects they've had or may have that, uh, could benefit from getting that attorney quality review at a lower price. That makes them more cost effective and more competitive with their clients.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Identifying practice groups and engaging with them to discuss specific projects is a targeted approach. How did you leverage technology or data analytics to identify these practice groups and evaluate the potential fit of their projects with your service offering, ensuring a more data-driven and efficient client acquisition process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: There's a number of ways to do that. Um, you have to kind of look in 2 large different categories. Larger law firms have a series of practice groups. They'll have some practice groups that are good targets and some that aren't. So if you look at the a law firm, you might say, well, some of this law firm isn't a good practice for is it a good target for me? But if I look at this law firm, if I look at the information that's available through various sources or even going as simple as going to a firm's website and saying, okay. What practice groups do they have? Are these practice groups that are good for us? They are. Then let's reach out to them. Then that's for kind of a general purpose law firm. The the second approach, uh, of kind of leveraging, I guess, you could say analytics, is looking for firms that specialize in these fields. And, yeah, there's a number of tools that are available for that that are relatively simple. And if you've been in the business marketplace for law long enough, there's some that are gonna come to mind. So that kinda gave us a good idea of who to target.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the different approaches to targeting law firms and specialized firms is insightful. Can you delve into the specific tools or methodologies you used to evaluate the fit of a practice group or a specialized firm, perhaps highlighting a tool or strategy that particularly stood out for its effectiveness in this process?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: I'd have to say it's not so much a tool because they're not that difficult to identify. You can look at a firm's website, or you can look at, you know, what type of law firm it is. It might say, we specialize in construction or mass tort or whatever it might be. Um, but I think it's more of an approach. Right? Uh, what was helpful in that instance was in identifying, uh, firms that did that kind of work was, uh, taking a consultative approach. And that's, I think, you know, the thing that you're asking, right, is what what process do you use? And in a consultative approach, we're gonna ask a lot of questions. We're gonna be lawyerly ourselves. We're gonna ask them about what they do and how they do it and where their pain points are and see if their pain points align with the offering that we have. If they do, we've gone a long way, uh, down the process of identifying someone who could be motivated to purchase our services. So that that takes, um, you know, some some some digging. And more importantly, it takes some listening rather than, you know, letting them talk rather than than you talk at them. Let them explain what their problems are. So I think a key thing there is the consultative approach.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: The consultative approach to client engagement is indeed a powerful strategy for identifying alignment and addressing pain points. How do you ensure scalability of this consultative approach across your sales and client services teams, especially as the business grows and the number of engagements increases?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, the, you know, the number of engagements can increase. The size of the individual engagements tends to remain more constant, at least in the business that I was in. But even in businesses where it's not, right, some law firms might have, 1 or 2 projects a year. Some might have 1 or 2 a month. Um, it's simply a matter of asking the right questions to the white people, and then encouraging to provide you with the information where you can then go to your solution. You can go to your well of information and say, hey. I can help you here. You've laid out to me what you're doing and how you're doing it and where where the pain points are or you know, with a consultative approach, they may not realize they have pain points. They might be doing something and thinking, yeah, it works fine, when you're like, wow, they don't really realize this could be done much more efficiently. So, uh, that's, uh, you know, in terms of scalability, I think it it's simply a matter of, uh, whether the whether it's a large target or a small target, the approach and the process is the same. Of course, as you expand and you add more people, you have more people doing it. So, uh, you know, there's a practical limit, I think, ultimately to how much one person can can juggle. And that varies on a lot of factors that, you know, probably aren't worth going into right now about about the particular business itself.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Understanding the consistency in approach regardless of the size of the engagement is important. What kind of tools or methodologies do you envision implementing to help your teams better capture, analyze, and utilize client data to enhance the effectiveness of the consultative approach at scale?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, I think what kind of tools or processes would I would I, uh, use? I think, you know, part of it is teaching people to listen, teaching them to not just talk at clients of, hey. I have this, this, and this to sell. A lot of people try to I guess they call it feature sell. It's like, this is all the neat stuff that we have, and isn't it great? The problem that you can run into is that your stuff might be great, but if they don't have a need for it, you're wasting each other's time. So I think training might be, uh, one of the key things is teaching people what questions to ask, techniques to get people talking, and identify the right people to talk to and getting them to provide you, uh, the information in a in a give and take. You know, my background is an attorney. Attorneys are are trained to ask questions. Um, and I think people think, you know, they're trained to ask tricky questions, but we're not. We're really trained to ask questions to try to get to the truth of a point or matter. So, you know, there's a a variety of training programs available, but I think that's kind of the key thing is having people who are trained in the consultative approach that know how to use a consultative approach, how to implement it by the type of questions they ask and the process by which they go about their engagement. I think that's the key, and that's the thing that allows you to expand the scalability. And, you know, you can always expand the number of people, uh, on a particular project. You know, you might have a a smaller project and, uh, uh, you know, one person can handle it. But on a larger project, just prospect, you might wanna bring in some subject matter experts. There might be more stakeholders in this in this larger, uh, project. You know, there's a lot of factors that are I hate to sound lawyerly. It's one of those kind of it depends questions. Uh, but, uh, it it depends on a a lot of factors that we that we don't know as you and I are sitting here talking right now about what would what would make us determine what we need to put that consultative approach into effect.\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Training and developing a questioning mindset are indeed foundational. Considering the role of technology in augmenting human capabilities, are there any specific data analytics or client relationship management (CRM) tools you believe could complement the consultative approach, especially in identifying nuanced client needs or patterns across engagements?  \\n\\n', \"Interviewee: Well, these these tools are expanding by the day. Um, you know, for example, I've used the CRM called HubSpot and there there was a time when you were, uh, identifying potential prospect, you have to input manually lots of data about this prospect, you know, what their addresses, phone numbers, you know, uh, you know, information. With HubSpot, um, if you type in their web domain, it'll automatically populate all that information. And a lot of that is information that's useful to you in a consultative approach to go, wow. This is the customers they have. This is the business they have. This is, you know, the numbers they have. This is the growth or declining growth that they have. Um, you know, here's, uh, you know, Wall Street Journal articles, uh, you know, um, you know, the the use of of AI and a lot of these more advanced tools, I think where they really help, uh, it's not that they're better or that humans are worse. Um, I think they're better at some things and worse at others. But the key thing is how do they work together? Uh, I think that's important in the legal space. You know, with attorneys, it's, uh, you know, they tend to be a little off putting, uh, towards a lot of technology. But you have to explain to them and show them how this is a tool just like a a law book was, a typewriter, a pen, or a pencil. Uh, and they're they have to know how to use this tool in order to do their job. And, uh, you know, the\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: HubSpot's automation for data input is indeed a time-saver, especially in the initial stages of prospecting. As you've mentioned the use of AI in more advanced tools, how do you see AI being integrated into the consultative approach, perhaps in terms of analyzing client data or suggesting relevant lines of questioning based on patterns identified in the data?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: I think that's that's it right there is, uh, in the consultative approach, the more you know going in, uh, and when I say the more you know, um, there's things that you can concretely know. You know, what a company's revenues are, that's a that's a concrete number. What a company's perception is is not. So, uh, you know, I think the advantage of these tools and the way they can help in the consultative approach is they can provide you information like, you know, are their revenues stagnant? Are they growing? Are they shrinking? You know, this would be helpful, you know, when the when you're consultative approach. You'd say, I see that your business has been on a decline. This practice group, your your revenues have been falling. Um, why do you think that is? Let them tell you. You know, um, the machine, uh, learning there can help suggest the course of action. You know, um, in the actual legal work itself, uh, there's things like technology assisted review that help narrow down out of this massive information. They'll narrow down, um, documents along a certain theme. And the more that you select certain types of inputs, the more it'll deliver those inputs. So I think that's one way that it can help. But I think the key thing is, uh, the the person and the and the artificial intelligence working collaboratively, um, is greater than either one of them as an individual. And the, uh, ability to help provide factual basis to your questions that are gonna be the core of your consultation, I think, is probably the key there.\\n\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Leveraging AI to understand and interpret less concrete aspects, such as a company's trajectory, is indeed a powerful application in the consultative approach. How do you envision ensuring that the human-AI collaboration remains transparent and understandable to your team, so they can effectively incorporate AI-generated insights into their client engagements?  \\n\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, I think there's a couple things I think. It has to it has to have a track record right as you use it. It needs to be solid. If the AI is giving you information that says this company is on a downward trajectory and it's on an upward trajectory that's going to cause a problem. I think just like a human being everything is always in a state of flux. It's in a state of growth and evolution and adjustments. So there might be situations where AI makes mistakes now ai doesn't make mistakes the way maybe I would of Simply being wrong, but it is subject to the the garbage in garbage or problem to a certain degree. So you is that happens? I think a process where We acknowledge that this can happen and that it doesn't AI tells us something it doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to do something on our own. I think of this process of Correction adjustment and increased learning is known and open and followed then I think you know people will work with it better just like they would a person or do the same circumstances\\n\\n\"], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!
